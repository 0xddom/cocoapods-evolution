All in all, it enables vendors to create simple, high performant and secure solutions for their Internet connected products with very little effort.\n\nThe Nabto Client SDK for iOS comes as a framework that provides a simple Objective C wrapper (NabtoClient.h) for accessing the underlying general Nabto Client SDK.
