The traditional method of loading individual images from disk is just too slow, especially while scrolling. Fast Image Cache was created specifically to solve this problem.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/path/FastImageCache","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Mallory Paine":"mpaine@gmail.com","Michael Potter":"michael@path.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/path/FastImageCache.git","tag":"1.4"},"source_files":"FastImageCache/FastImageCache","requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
