For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate URLSessionRequest into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'URLSessionRequest', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\n[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.\n\nOnce you have your Swift package set up, adding URLSessionRequest as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.\n```\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/dejacs/URLSessionRequest\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"1.0.0\"))\n]\n\n```\n\n## Supported\n\nIt's implementation was tested for:\n- URLSession\n- Alamofire Session\n\nTo add a support for other session type, make it conform with `SessionProtocol`.\n\n## Features\n\n- Fetch a data with URL or URLRequest and decoding to a Decodable Object or Array\n- Decode data to a Decodable Object\n- Verify errors in request result\n\n### Plus:\n- Mapped status code response\n- Mapped API errors\n- Extension for DispatchQueue and URLSession (for testing)\n- Extension of JSONDecoder with keyDecodingStrategy on init\n\n## Example\n\nTo run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.\n\n## License\n\nURLSessionRequest is available under the MIT license.
