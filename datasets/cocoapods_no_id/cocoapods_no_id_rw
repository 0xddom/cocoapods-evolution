Well, unlike the others out there, `MMMSwitch`:\n\n* Works great in Auto Layout environments\n  * It won't get distorted when it gets resized due to changing constraints or when it gets its size animated\n* Has a *rich state callback method* \n  * It can distinguish between all user-distinguishable states, so it can tell you whether it's completely off, or if, for instance, the user's pressing it down but has yet switched its state yet. \n  * Too much info for you? No problem -- just use the callback but check `MMMSwitch`'s `isOn` parameter inside of the callback and get the basic on/off info you want.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch/","screenshots":["http://f.cl.ly/items/2x123j0K3t471g3e0I0C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.13%20PM.gif","http://cl.ly/image/042L0F381J3n/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.15%20PM.gif","http://f.cl.ly/items/2A1s0o2M193M3s310D3C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.16%20PM.gif"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":"Matthew McCroskey","social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/mmccroskey","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"source_files":["Pod","Pod/**/*.{h,m}"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}

Well, unlike the others out there, `MMMSwitch`:\n\n* Works great in Auto Layout environments\n  * It won't get distorted when it gets resized due to changing constraints or when it gets its size animated\n* Has a *rich state callback method* \n  * It can distinguish between all user-distinguishable states, so it can tell you whether it's completely off, or if, for instance, the user's pressing it down but has yet switched its state yet. \n  * Too much info for you? No problem -- just use the callback but check `MMMSwitch`'s `isOn` parameter inside of the callback and get the basic on/off info you want.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch/","screenshots":["http://f.cl.ly/items/2x123j0K3t471g3e0I0C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.13%20PM.gif","http://cl.ly/image/042L0F381J3n/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.15%20PM.gif","http://f.cl.ly/items/2A1s0o2M193M3s310D3C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.16%20PM.gif"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":"Matthew McCroskey","social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/mmccroskey","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch.git","tag":"0.1.1"},"source_files":["Pod","Pod/**/*.{h,m}"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}

It is also environment based so you can define different config files for different environments.\n\nThe pod will look for a config file that matches the name of your current configuration.\ne.g. If you are building your debug configuration it will look for config.debug.plist in your application bundle. If you build a target with your release configuration it will look for config.release.plist. If you create a custom configuration for your project called beta and your build uses that configuration then the pod will look for config.beta.plist. Note that they are alway in lowercase.\n\nIf you don't want to do configuration specific config files you can just use config.default.plist or config.plist.\n\nThe order of priority is as follows:\n * config.<current build configuration name>.plist\n * config.default.plist\n * config.plist","homepage":"https://github.com/CruGlobal/CRUConfig-ios","license":"MIT","authors":{"Harro":"michael.harrison@cru.org"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/CruGlobal/CRUConfig-ios.git","tag":"1.1.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"source_files":"CRUConfig/Classes/**/*","pod_target_xcconfig":{"GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS":"CRUCONFIG_CURRENT_BUILD_CONFIGURATION=$(CONFIGURATION)"},"migrated":true}
