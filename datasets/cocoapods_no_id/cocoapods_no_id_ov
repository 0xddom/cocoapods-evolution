G is a dictionary, indexed by vertices. For any vertex v, G[v] is itself a dictionary, indexed by the neighbors of v. For any edge v->w, G[v][w] is the length of the edge.\n\nThis code is a port of a Python implementation of Dijkstra algorithm suggested by David Eppstein.\n\nSee http://code.activestate.com/recipes/119466-dijkstras-algorithm-for-shortest-paths/?in=user-218935\n\nIt also provides an implementation of a priority dictionary: a key value map which is also ordered by values.\n\nThe implementation relies on C++ stl. stl::map and stl::make_heap do most of heavy lifting.
