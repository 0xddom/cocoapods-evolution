To collect the information required we needed a flexible, future-proof and easy to use tracking system that enables us to add, remove and swap the underlying integrations with analytical systems and services with minimal impact on our applications' code. We also wanted to solve the problem of keeping the required event metadata up-to-date whenever the requirements change.\nJustTrack is the event tracking solution we built for that.","homepage":"https://github.com/JustEat/JustTrack","license":{"type":"Apache 2.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Just Eat iOS team":"justeat.ios.team@gmail.com","Federico Cappelli":"federico.cappelli@just-eat.com","Joakim Lazakis":"joakim.lazakis@just-eat.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/justeat/JustTrack.git","tag":"3.2.0"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/justeat_tech","swift_version":"4.2","platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source_files":"JustTrack/Classes/**/*","preserve_paths":"JustTrack/JEEventsGenerator/*","testspecs":[{"name":"UnitTests","test_type":"unit","source_files":"JustTrack/UnitTests/*"}],"migrated":true}
