The screenshot can then be manipulated to make view appear inactive.\n\n*KSSlideController*\n\nThis controller allows the use of slide in view controllers on both sides of the screen. This functionality was originally seen in apps such as Facebook for presenting a menu. However, KSSlideController is not restricted to just menus. Through the use of configurable properties, a broad range of implementations can be created.\n\n*KSPullDownController*\n\nThis controller allows the use of a view controller to be pulled down do display another view controller. It can be used to create something as simple as a “pull-to-refresh” controller. However, it can also be used to present other views such as menus. Through the use of configurable properties, a broad range of implementations can be created.\n\n*KSViewShadow*\n\nThis controller adds a configurable shadow to any view that is passed to it.","homepage":"https://github.com/kickstandapps/KSFramework","license":"BSD","authors":{"Kickstand Apps":"developer@kickstandapps.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/kickstandapps/KSFramework.git","tag":"1.0"},"requires_arc":true,"subspecs":[{"name":"KSImageAdditions","source_files":"KSImageAdditions/*.{h,m}","frameworks":["Accelerate","QuartzCore"]},{"name":"KSInactiveImageView","source_files":"KSInactiveImageView/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"KSFramework/KSImageAdditions":[]}},{"name":"KSViewShadow","source_files":"KSViewShadow/*.{h,m}","frameworks":"QuartzCore"},{"name":"KSSlideController","source_files":"KSSlideController/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"KSFramework/KSInactiveImageView":[],"KSFramework/KSViewShadow":[]}},{"name":"KSPullDownController","source_files":"KSPullDownController/*.{h,m}"}],"migrated":true}
