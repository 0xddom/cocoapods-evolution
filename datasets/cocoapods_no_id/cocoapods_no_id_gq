It reproduces the index bar seen in the Contacts app on iOS and styled to match both iOS6 and iOS7 by default. `GDIIndexBar` can also be customized through the appearance protocol or by subclassing. \n\n                    `GDIIndexBar` behaves by automatically sizing and positioning itself on the right side of the provided `UITableView`. Subclasses can alter this by overriding the `layoutSubviews` method of the `GDIIndexBar`. `GDIIndexBar` provides automatic vertical adjustments for the index bar by setting a `GDIIndexBarAlignment` value. \n\n                    `GDIIndexBar` is supports being added directly to a `UITableView` as a child subview, or can exist in a different view than the table while still positioning automatically. *NOTE:* In order to correctly receive touch events as a subview of a `UITableView`, the `delaysContentTouches` property is automatically set to `NO`.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/gdavis/GDIIndexBar","screenshots":["http://f.cl.ly/items/1a3Z0T3A2X1x0W023W2R/GDIIndexBar-1.png","http://f.cl.ly/items/2x2H2x0A3T3k0i3y0p1i/GDIIndexBar-2.png"],"license":"MIT","authors":{"Grant Davis":"grant@grantdavisinteractive.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/gdavis/GDIIndexBar.git","tag":"0.2.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Classes","migrated":true}
