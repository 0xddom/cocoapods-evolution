While recording such data is relatively simple, it is often challenging to share and restream this data to other people and applications. Such capability is very valuable for a range of applications such as a context-aware prototyping/developing platform, an integrated data recording and analysis tool, and a sensor-data based video editing system. To enable such complex operations, we propose Senbay, a platform for instant sensing, integrating, and restreaming multiple-sensor data streams. The platform embeds collected sensor data into a video frame using an animated two-dimensional barcode via real-time video processing. The video-embedded sensor data, dubbed Senbay Video, can be easily restreamed to other people and reused by data rich, context-aware applications.","homepage":"http://www.senbay.info","license":{"type":"Apache License, Version 2.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Yuuki Nishiyama":"yuuki.nishiyama@oulu.fi"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tetujin/SenbayKit.git","tag":"0.2.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"10.0"},"swift_version":"4.2","source_files":"SenbayKit/Classes/**/*","frameworks":["OpenGLES","AVFoundation","CoreMotion","CoreLocation","UIKit","CoreBluetooth"],"dependencies":{"CocoaAsyncSocket":[],"HaishinKit":["~> 0.10.5"]},"migrated":true}

While recording such data is relatively simple, it is often challenging to share and restream this data to other people and applications. Such capability is very valuable for a range of applications such as a context-aware prototyping/developing platform, an integrated data recording and analysis tool, and a sensor-data based video editing system. To enable such complex operations, we propose Senbay, a platform for instant sensing, integrating, and restreaming multiple-sensor data streams. The platform embeds collected sensor data into a video frame using an animated two-dimensional barcode via real-time video processing. The video-embedded sensor data, dubbed Senbay Video, can be easily restreamed to other people and reused by data rich, context-aware applications.","homepage":"http://www.senbay.info","license":{"type":"Apache2","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Yuuki Nishiyama":"yuuki.nishiyama@oulu.fi"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tetujin/SenbayKit.git","tag":"0.2.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"10.0"},"swift_version":"4.2","source_files":"SenbayKit/Classes/**/*","frameworks":["OpenGLES","AVFoundation","CoreMotion","CoreLocation","UIKit","CoreBluetooth"],"dependencies":{"CocoaAsyncSocket":[],"HaishinKit":["~> 0.10.5"]},"migrated":true}
