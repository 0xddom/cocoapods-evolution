And for OS X: KISSmetrics, Mixpanel and HockeyAppOSX. It does this by using CocoaPods subspecs to let you decide which libraries you'd like to use.

It’s important on iOS too because a hardware keyboard improves speed and ergonomics, which makes an iPad an even more powerful productivity machine.\n\nApps created with AppKit tend to have better support for keyboard control compared to UIKit-based apps. I believe the principal reason for this is that most AppKit components respond to key input out of the box, while most UIKit components do not. KeyboardKit aims to narrow this gap by providing subclasses of UIKit components that respond to key commands.","source":{"git":"https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit.git","tag":"1.1.1"},"swift_versions":"5.0","platforms":{"ios":"11.0"},"source_files":"KeyboardKit/*.{h,m,swift}","public_header_files":["KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.h","KeyboardKit/BarButtonItem.h"],"exclude_files":["KeyboardKit/Info.plist","KeyboardKit/ResponderChainDebugging.m","KeyboardKit/UpdateLocalisedStringKeys.swift"],"resources":"KeyboardKit/Localised/*.lproj","swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}
