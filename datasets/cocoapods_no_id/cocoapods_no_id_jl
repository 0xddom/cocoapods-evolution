We find the most critical juncture in your app to retain or activate the highest number (or in case of retention most valuable) of users.\n\t\t2- What message? We A/B test different message content to find the best performing one and then automatically use that for future messages.\n\t\t3- To whom? We automatically define segments based on activity, spending, location and usage patterns and send messages relevant to each segment.\n\t\t4- What delay? It makes a difference how long after a user's last interaction you message them (one day, 4 days, 2 weeks...) and we find what works best for each individual through modeling users with similar behaviours.\n\t\t5- When during the day? Again sending a message at a time where users are more likely to view and open it; we find the best time through tests.","homepage":"http://www.dataeagle.tech","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Soroush Khodaii":"soroush@dataeagle.tech"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/elrusho/DataEagle.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"DataEagle/Classes/**/*","migrated":true}
