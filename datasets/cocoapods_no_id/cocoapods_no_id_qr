{"name":"DownPicker","version":"0.1.33","summary":"Lightweight class library for creating drop down list controls for iOS.","description":"DownPicker is an extremely light-weight class library for creating DropDownList / ComboBox controls for iOS that will behave like their HTML / Android counterparts.\nYou'll only need a standard UITextField and few lines of code.\n\nDownPicker is basically a *control interface wrapper*, meaning that you won't use it as a control - it will use an existing UITextField control instead.\nThis is a good thing, because you'll be able to design, positioning and skin your UITextField like you always do, programmatically or inside a *Storyboard* UI, depending on how you are used to work. You won't change your style, as it will adapt to suit yours.\n\nHowever, if you don't like the *control wrapper* pattern, you can just use it as a *custom control* using the included **UIDownPicker** class. It's entirely up to you (and very easy to install in both scenarios).\n\nDownPicker is released under MIT License.\nInstallation instructions, examples and documentation are available in the included README.md file.","homepage":"https://github.com/Darkseal/DownPicker","screenshots":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Darkseal/DownPicker/gh-pages/images/DownPicker/UITextField.DownPicker.png","license":"MIT","authors":{"Ryan":"ryan@ryadel.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/Darkseal/DownPicker.git","tag":"0.1.33"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/ryadel_com","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Pod/Classes/*.{h,m}","resource_bundles":{"DownPicker":["Pod/Assets/*.png"]},"public_header_files":"Pod/Classes/*.h","migrated":true}
