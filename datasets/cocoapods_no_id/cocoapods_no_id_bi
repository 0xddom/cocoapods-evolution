Developer acknowledges and agrees that it may not use the Vungle Platform in connection with any Developer Apps or Content containing, consisting of or promoting discrimination, illegal activities, hate speech, graphic violence, firearms, tobacco, illegal drugs, pornography, profanity, obscenity or sexually explicit material, and that it will notify Vungle immediately of any Developer Apps or Content relating to alcohol or gambling. Developer agrees that Vungle has no responsibility for any Content, and Vungle has no obligation or ability to monitor or edit the Developer Apps. Developer agrees to provide as much advance notice as is reasonably practicable (but in no event less than fifteen (15) days’ notice) regarding any material changes to the nature or design of any Developer App, including without limitation changes to the placement of Vungle Advertisement inventory, the type of Content, or the target audience.\nTracking Data. Developer acknowledges that unique identifiers and other technologies may be used in connection with the Vungle SDK Vungle Advertisements in order to collect and use data regarding advertisement performance and end user interests and to display Vungle Advertisements to end users, and that the collection of such data is regulated by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6506 and the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 312 (collectively, \"COPPA\").

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Vungle shall pay to Developer amounts calculated in accordance with the applicable insertion order entered into between the parties and the definitions of CPM and Net Revenue set forth herein. Developer acknowledges that all payments hereunder shall be based on the impression counts used by the applicable Advertisers to pay Vungle. For the avoidance of doubt, all payments hereunder are based on advertisement requests from the Developer Apps that are actually fulfilled with a Vungle Advertisement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. All amounts received from activities Vungle deems to be fraudulent may be refunded to Advertisers in Vungle’s sole discretion.\nPayment Terms. Vungle agrees to pay all amounts due hereunder within 60 days after the last day of the month in which Vungle received the corresponding payment from the Advertiser, provided that no check will be issued for any amount less than $50 U.S. If there are any payment fees from the receiving bank, immediate bank or from paypal, Developer will be responsible for these fees. All unpaid earnings will rollover to the next pay period. All payments will be made in U.S. dollars ($U.S.). Vungle may deduct from such payments any withholding, sales, value added, and other applicable taxes (other than its net income taxes) which Vungle is required by law to deduct. Developer is responsible for paying any other taxes, duties, or fees for which Developer is legally responsible.\n \n"},"authors":{"Vungle":"tech-support@vungle.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source":{"git":"https://github.com/Vungle/iOS-SDK.git","tag":"4.0.8"},"resources":"VungleSDK.embeddedframework/Resources/*.*","vendored_frameworks":"VungleSDK.embeddedframework/VungleSDK.framework","xcconfig":{"OTHER_LDFLAGS":"-ObjC"},"frameworks":["AdSupport","AudioToolbox","AVFoundation","CFNetwork","CoreGraphics","CoreMedia","Foundation","MediaPlayer","QuartzCore","StoreKit","SystemConfiguration","UIKit","WebKit"],"libraries":"z","migrated":true}

Developer may not, and may not authorize or encourage any third party to: (i) generate fraudulent impressions of or fraudulent clicks on any advertisements, including through repeated manual clicks, the use of robots or other automated tools or any other method that may lead to artificially high numbers of impressions, downloads, or clicks; (ii) edit, modify, filter, or change the order of the information contained in any Vungle Advertisement, or remove, obscure or minimize any Vungle Advertisement in any way; and (iii) redirect an end user away from any web page accessed by an end user after selecting or clicking on any part of a Vungle Advertisement (\"Advertiser Page\"), provide a version of the Advertiser Page different from the page an end user would access by going directly to the Advertiser Page, or intersperse any content between the Vungle Advertisement and the Advertiser Page. Vungle may suspend Developer’s use of the Vungle Platform and/or terminate this Agreement immediately should Developer violate the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.\nContent. Developer acknowledges and agrees that it may not use the Vungle Platform in connection with any Developer Apps or Content containing, consisting of or promoting discrimination, illegal activities, hate speech, graphic violence, firearms, tobacco, illegal drugs, pornography, profanity, obscenity or sexually explicit material, and that it will notify Vungle immediately of any Developer Apps or Content relating to alcohol or gambling. Developer agrees that Vungle has no responsibility for any Content, and Vungle has no obligation or ability to monitor or edit the Developer Apps. Developer agrees to provide as much advance notice as is reasonably practicable (but in no event less than fifteen (15) days’ notice) regarding any material changes to the nature or design of any Developer App, including without limitation changes to the placement of Vungle Advertisement inventory, the type of Content, or the target audience.\nTracking Data. Developer acknowledges that unique identifiers and other technologies may be used in connection with the Vungle SDK Vungle Advertisements in order to collect and use data regarding advertisement performance and end user interests and to display Vungle Advertisements to end users, and that the collection of such data is regulated by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6506 and the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 312 (collectively, \"COPPA\").

Developer shall provide or make available to users of each Developer App a privacy notification in a conspicuous manner (via a privacy policy or other method appropriate for the type of such Developer App)which (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (ii) to the extent applicable to the type of such Developer App, discloses to users of such Developer App that cookies, web beacons and other technologies may be used in connection with such Developer App. Developer shall comply with such other requirements that Vungle may issue in writing from time to time (including through the Vungle Platform) that relate to compliance with laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and industry standards relating to online advertising.\nPayment Amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Vungle shall pay to Developer amounts calculated in accordance with the applicable insertion order entered into between the parties and the definitions of CPM and Net Revenue set forth herein. Developer acknowledges that all payments hereunder shall be based on the impression counts used by the applicable Advertisers to pay Vungle. For the avoidance of doubt, all payments hereunder are based on advertisement requests from the Developer Apps that are actually fulfilled with a Vungle Advertisement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. All amounts received from activities Vungle deems to be fraudulent may be refunded to Advertisers in Vungle’s sole discretion.\nPayment Terms. Vungle agrees to pay all amounts due hereunder within 60 days after the last day of the month in which Vungle received the corresponding payment from the Advertiser, provided that no check will be issued for any amount less than $50 U.S. If there are any payment fees from the receiving bank, immediate bank or from paypal, Developer will be responsible for these fees. All unpaid earnings will rollover to the next pay period. All payments will be made in U.S. dollars ($U.S.). Vungle may deduct from such payments any withholding, sales, value added, and other applicable taxes (other than its net income taxes) which Vungle is required by law to deduct. Developer is responsible for paying any other taxes, duties, or fees for which Developer is legally responsible.\n \n"},"authors":{"Vungle":"tech-support@vungle.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source":{"git":"https://github.com/Vungle/iOS-SDK.git","tag":"3.2.1"},"resources":"VungleSDK.embeddedframework/Resources/*.*","vendored_frameworks":"VungleSDK.embeddedframework/VungleSDK.framework","xcconfig":{"OTHER_LDFLAGS":"-ObjC"},"frameworks":["AdSupport","AudioToolbox","AVFoundation","CFNetwork","CoreGraphics","CoreMedia","Foundation","MediaPlayer","QuartzCore","StoreKit","SystemConfiguration","UIKit","WebKit"],"libraries":["z","sqlite3"],"migrated":true}
