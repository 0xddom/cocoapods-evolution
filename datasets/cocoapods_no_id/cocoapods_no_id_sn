Videos contain a player with a timeline and scrubbing. GIFs can also be displayed in an ABMediaView, via lazy-loading from the web, or set via NSData. The GIF that is downloaded is saved as a UIImage object for easy storage. Audio can also be displayed in the player by simply providing a url from the web or on disk. A major added functionality is that this mediaView has a queue and can present mediaViews in fullscreen mode. There is functionality which allows the view to be minimized by swiping, where it sits in the bottom right corner as a thumbnail. Videos can continue playing and be heard from this position.
