You also need several tools and services to make data-driven decisions.\nLike most app owners, you end up implementing and maintaining numerous SDKs ranging from analytics, attribution, push notification, remarketing,\nmonetization, etc. But embedding multiple 3rd party libraries creates a number of unintended consequences and hidden costs. From not being\nable to move as fast as you want, to bloating and destabilizing your app, to losing control and ownership of your 1st party data.\n\nmParticle solves all these problems with one lightweight SDK. Implement new partners without changing code or waiting for app store approval.\nImprove stability and security within your app. We enable our clients to spend more time innovating and less time integrating.","homepage":"http://www.mparticle.com","license":{"type":"Apache 2.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"mParticle":"support@mparticle.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mParticle/mParticle-iOS-SDK.git","tag":"5.4.2"},"documentation_url":"http://docs.mparticle.com","social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/mparticles","requires_arc":true,"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"default_subspecs":["mParticle","CrashReporter","Adjust","Appboy","AppsFlyer","BranchMetrics","comScore","Flurry","Kahuna","Kochava","Localytics","Tune","Wootric"],"deprecated":true,"subspecs":[{"name":"Core-SDK","public_header_files":["Pod/Classes/mParticle.h","Pod/Classes/MPEnums.h","Pod/Classes/MPUserSegments.h","Pod/Classes/Event/MPEvent.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPCommerce.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPCommerceEvent.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPCart.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPProduct.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPPromotion.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPTransactionAttributes.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPBags.h"],"source_files":"Pod/Classes/**/*","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"frameworks":["Accounts","CoreGraphics","CoreLocation","CoreTelephony","Foundation","Security","Social","SystemConfiguration","UIKit"],"weak_frameworks":["AdSupport","iAd"],"libraries":["c++","sqlite3","z"]},{"name":"Adjust","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Adjust":["~> 4.3"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_ADJUST 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Appboy","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Appboy-iOS-SDK":["~> 2.19"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_APPBOY 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"AppsFlyer","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"AppsFlyer-SDK":["~> 4.3"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_APPSFLYER 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"BranchMetrics","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Branch":["~> 0.11"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_BRANCHMETRICS 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"comScore","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"ComScore-iOS":["3.1510.23"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_COMSCORE 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"frameworks":["AVFoundation","CoreMedia","MediaPlayer"]},{"name":"Crittercism","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"CrittercismSDK":["5.4.0"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_CRITTERCISM 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Flurry","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Flurry-iOS-SDK/FlurrySDK":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_FLURRY 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Kahuna","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"KahunaSDK":["1.0.571"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_KAHUNA 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Kochava","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Kochava":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_KOCHAVA 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Localytics","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Localytics":["~> 3.5"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_LOCALYTICS 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Tune","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_TUNE 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Wootric","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"WootricSDK":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_WOOTRIC 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"mParticle","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_MPARTICLE 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"CrashReporter","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"mParticle-CrashReporter":["~> 1.2"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_CRASH_REPORTER 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}}],"migrated":true}

This typically involves transitionning between a login/signup page and the actual app interface.\n\nMany apps implement this lazily by presenting a login view controller above the main app interface. This project offers a cleaner and simple alternative via a controller that can properly manage these transitions for you by using proper view controller containment. This approach has many benefits (e.g cleaner and more logical structure, the unused interface can be completely deallocated from memory when not in use, etc).","homepage":"https://github.com/cgossain/AppController","license":"MIT","authors":{"Christian Gossain":"cgossain@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cgossain/AppController.git","tag":"0.7.2"},"platforms":{"ios":"10.3"},"swift_versions":"5.0","source_files":"AppController/Classes/**/*.swift","swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}
