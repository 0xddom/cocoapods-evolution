{"name":"MPSkewed","version":"0.2.0","summary":"Skewed collection view cells with Parallax inspired by http://capptivate.co/2014/01/18/timbre-2/.","description":"\n## History\n\nI wanted to make something like this since I saw [this collectionView](http://capptivate.co/2014/01/18/timbre-2/)\nWhile I was waiting to have the time to make it [TWRSkewedCollectionView](https://github.com/chasseurmic/TWRSkewedCollectionView) came out.\nSuddenly I forked it and [decided to contribute](https://github.com/MP0w/TWRSkewedCollectionView/commits/master),\nI was going to add the parallax effect when I realized that there were some decision that I didn't like so I preferred to use that as a base but I need to edit a lot of stuff that probably the original owner do not want to change.\nFor example: I want a collection view that works like any other collectionView, where the user needs to provide a dataSource instead of load a simple list of URL for the images.\njust to have it as exensible as the original CollectionView, and have more reusable code.\nI don't like nib, and this project shouldn't be a collectionview but just a cell (+ layout for the parallax\nEven for the way how the original is structured is difficult to add the parallax effect or edit the behaviors, and it becomes too much confusionary...\nInstead of use a custom collectionView+cell+layout here you just have to use the cell (and the layout if you want the parallax)... I tried to made something that preserve all the other behaviors and settings disponible in the collectionView\n\nAt the end I guess there is no code shared between the two, TWRSkewedCollectionView is just simple to use but not really reusable/customizable since it does all inside the collection view subclass and the delegate and datasource are broken, however it's a good work, just I wanted it different.\n\n## MPSkewed\nIf you want to have the skewed cell without parallax just use the cell class, just note that you should use a collection view layout like the flow layout in wich you have all the cell's height equal and the line spacing equal to -height/3 (that even resolve the problem that cell is reused before it really disappear because of the imageview that go outside the cell).\nThis is the more clean way to have cell tappable everywhere and you can adjust the padding from the cells using the lineSpacing property of MPSkewedCell.\nI could use an internal delegate + objcRuntime to preserve the delegates [like I did here](https://github.com/MP0w/TWRSkewedCollectionView/commits/master), but to preserve all the delegates it would become not so clean...\nthe only problem of my new choice is that : you can't use differents sizes for the cells and the real itemSize is different from the one you specify,\npassing 300 it become : 300*2/3-lineSpacing.\nIf some people will tell me that this choice is not the best maybe I will return to my initial approach [my initial approach](https://github.com/MP0w/TWRSkewedCollectionView/commits/master)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/MP0w/MPSkewed","screenshots":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MP0w/MPSkewed/master/img/inaction.gif","license":"BSD","authors":{"Alex Manzella":"manzopower@icloud.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/MP0w/MPSkewed.git","tag":"0.2.0"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/manzopower","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Classes/","migrated":true}

Can be used in AppStore apps.","description":"Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing\nthat you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the\niOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,\ntouches and active views, and uploads it all in\nnear-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive\ninto the data. Example use cases:\n\n* User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\ntesting lab to record both the screen and your tester's\nreactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n* Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\nusing your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\nproblems.\n* Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete\nwith a trace of how the tester reached it.\n\nThis version of Lookback is safe to use on the Apple AppStore,\nbut this safety has heavy performance penalties. If you just\nwant to use Lookback for video bug reports and similar\ninternally while developing your app, consider using\nLookback HD (the \"Lookback\" pod).\n\nSee some more examples over at http://lookback.io/examples.","homepage":"http://lookback.io/","license":{"type":"Commercial","file":"lookback/LICENSE.md"},"authors":{"Nevyn Bengtsson":"nevyn@lookback.io","Brian Gerstle":"bgerstle@lookback.io","Pete Nelson":"pete@lookback.io"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/lookback","dependencies":{"PDKTZipArchive":[]},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"documentation_url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lookback-public/docs/ios/1.4.1.1.g03d8c28/Lookback_h/index.html","source":{"http":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lookback-public/sdk/lookback-sdk-1.4.1.1.g03d8c28.zip"},"source_files":"lookback/Safe/Lookback.framework/Versions/A/Headers/*.h","resources":"lookback/Lookback-Resources/Lookback.bundle","preserve_paths":["lookback/LICENSE.md","lookback/Safe/Lookback.framework"],"frameworks":["Accelerate","AVFoundation","AudioToolbox","VideoToolbox","CoreVideo","CoreMedia","SystemConfiguration","MediaPlayer","MessageUI","MobileCoreServices","ImageIO","QuartzCore","Lookback"],"xcconfig":{"FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS":"\"$(PODS_ROOT)/LookbackSafe/Lookback/Safe\"","OTHER_LDFLAGS":"$(inherited) -ObjC"},"requires_arc":false,"deprecated":true,"migrated":true}
