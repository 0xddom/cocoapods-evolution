The easiest option was\nto create this behavior using SpriteKit. As its use-cases were turning a little more \"complex\", a decent API was built on top of it. The usage was good enough\nto be used in all platforms, because the core functionality is built in a SKNode, so it's completly flexible if importing in UIKit.\n\nThere are both SKScene and SKView - which suits better your scenario - to be called directly, there is no need to create any extra SKScene/SKView to put the\nRevolutionary SKNode in.","authors":{"Guilherme C.
