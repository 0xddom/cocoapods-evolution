Returns end of day. Compare two dates by specified NSCalendarUnit units. Return NSDateComponents for specified NSCalendarUnit units. Returns default NSCalendar.\n* __NSFileManager+VRDocumentsDirectory__ - quick access for Documents directory and Temporary directory paths. Random file names generation. etc.\n* __NSMutableDictionary+VRExchangeKeys__ - exchanges keys in dictionary.\n* __NSObject+VRPropertiesProcessing__ - process object properties with blocks. Hash, equality & encode/decode by properties for any object.\n* __NSObject+VRProtocolConformation__ - checks if object/class responds to all selectors required by protocol. Useful as precondition check of object in delegate setter.\n* __RTProtocol+VRMethods__ - returns methods defined in protocol.\n* __NSString+VRmd5__ - MD5 hash on string.\n* __NSTimer+VRWithBlock__ - timer that executes block instead of selector.\n* __NSOperationQueue+VRNamedBlock__ - add named block operation to queue.\n\n## Macros\n* __VREnumXXX__ - generates enums with utility functions. NSStringFromXXX returns enum constant by value. isValidXXX checks range of enum value.\n* __VRLOGxxx__ - multilevel logging & assertion macros. Could be connected to preferable logging system. VRPRECONDITIONxxx macros to implement light design by contract.\n* __VRKeyName__ - stringifyes expression to key for `-[NSCoder encodeObject:withKey:]`. Useful to make names via help of XCode autocompletion.\n* __VRSingleton__ - return singleton.\n* __VROBJCTYPExxx__ - returns Objective-C type string representation of the passed variable (or type).
