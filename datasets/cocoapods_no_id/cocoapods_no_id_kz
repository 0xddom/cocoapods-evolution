It can log the name of the file in which it appears, the name of the declaration and the line number. Different types of logs are supported as well: text = 🔤, debug = 🚥, warning = ⚠️, error = ❌, fixme = 💊.\n\nThere is a default 'DPrint.log' method which accepts the following arguments:\n* #item (Any) -> The item(s) to print.\n* #path (String)\t-> The name of the file in which it appears (optional).\n* #functionName (String) -> The name of the declaration in which it appears (optional).\n* #lineNo (Int) -> The line number on which it appears (optional).\n* #messageType (DPrintMessageType)\t-> The type of icon to show when printing the message (optional).\nFive more convenient methods have been provided to help distinguish logs based on type (i.e. DPrint.logText, DPrint.logDebug, DPrint.logError, DPrint.logFixMe, DPrint.logWarning). See usage below.\n\n## Usage:\n\nIn your class:\n\n```Swift\nimport DPrint\n```\n\nThen when you want to log something use one of the following methods:\n```Swift\nDPrint.log(\"blah\", [\"item\", \"item 1\"], [\"item\": 6, \"item2\": 8], 9)\nDPrint.logText([2, 4], \"text\")\nDPrint.logDebug(\"A debug message\")\nDPrint.logError(\"An error message\")\nDPrint.logFixMe(\"Fix me please\")\nDPrint.logWarning(\"Please be careful\")\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n```\nFile: ViewController.swift | Function: viewDidLoad() | lineNo: 18\n-> blah\n-> [\"item\", \"item 1\"]\n-> [\"item\": 6, \"item2\": 8]\n-> 9\n🔤 | File: ViewController.swift | Function: viewDidLoad() | lineNo: 21\n-> [2, 4]\n🔤 | File: ViewController.swift | Function: viewDidLoad() | lineNo: 21\n-> text\n🚥 | File: ViewController.swift | Function: viewDidLoad() | lineNo: 22\n-> A debug message\n❌ | File: ViewController.swift | Function: viewDidLoad() | lineNo: 23\n-> An error message\n💊 | File: ViewController.swift | Function: viewDidLoad() | lineNo: 24\n-> Fix me please\n⚠️ | File: ViewController.swift | Function: viewDidLoad() | lineNo: 25\n-> Please be careful\n```","homepage":"https://github.com/GErakleous/DPrint","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"George Erakleous":"g.erakleous@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/GErakleous/DPrint.git","tag":"0.2.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"10.3"},"source_files":"DPrint/Classes/**/*","pushed_with_swift_version":"echo \"3.0\" > .swift-version","migrated":true}
