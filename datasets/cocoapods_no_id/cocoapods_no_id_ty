During the Early Access Program Dynatrace will be in the stage of 'Early Adoption' and is provisioned for test purposes only.

Therefore, Auxiliary Programs shall only be installed on computers which are regularly used by the Client for test purposes and are the property of or are permanently owned by the Client ('Designated Computers'). The use of Auxiliary Programs in a productive environment without any additional testing or adaptation to the specific requirements of an individual system environment may cause severe system failure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Early Adoption Program Services are provided AS IS, with no warranties, express or implied. Client agrees that due to the nature of the Early Adoption Program, Client may receive non-public technology, know-how and trade secrets, including, without limitation, ideas, concepts, designs, specifications, computer programs and strategies.

{"name":"KIPageView","version":"0.0.1","summary":"KIPageView","description":"## KIPageView\nUITableView 很强大，可是只能竖向滚动；UICollectionView 可以解决各种布局难题，但是稍显复杂，对于一些简单的需求，有点杀鸡用牛刀的感觉。\n\n在 iOS6 以前，还没有 UICollectionView，为了实现横向滚动的 UITableView，只有自己动手写组件。为了达到和 UITableView 差不多的效果，就得先弄清其内部实现机制是怎么回事。\n\n在渲染 View 的时候，是很耗系统资源的，如果创建大量的 View, 系统运行将变得异常缓慢，甚至导致内存耗尽。但是，在实际应用中，我们难免会遇到大量的数据需要显示，如果每显示一个数据，我们都创建一个 View，那应用程序的体验将相当糟糕。所以 Apple 为 iOS 开发者提供了 UITableView，Google 为 Android 开发者提供了 ListView。\n\n简单来讲，UITableView 采用复用机制，其只会显示其可见区域内的 UITableViewCell。我们在滑动的过程中，当超出 UITableView 可见区域的 Cell，将会从 UITableView 中移除，并加入回收池中以作复用。当 UITableView 需要显示新的 Cell，会先从回收池中查找是否有相应的 Cell 可以重用（通过 dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:）。如果有，则直接将其重新显示；如果没有，则创建新的 Cell。这样一来，就可以避免因创建过多的 View，导致内存耗尽的尴尬情况。\n\n了解了其内部的运行原理，我们也可以实现一个自己的 UITableView。\n\n很常见的一个应用场景——显示图片：如果显示一张图片，我们用一个 UIImageView 足矣，如果要显示多张图片，并且可以左右滚动，最简单的办法是用一个 UIScrollView 包含多个 UIImageView, 但是这样带来的后果则是，如果图片数据量较大，那这个程序根本没有办法正常使用。如果我们还需要实现无限循环滚动，那这个解决方案肯定是不行的。所以这时候，就得我们自己实现一个 UITableView。\n\n最开始，我写了一个组件叫 KIFlowView，实现了上面讲的需求，但是都是 iOS5 时代的产物了，难免过于陈旧。在后续的工作中也发现，类似的需求其实挺多的，比如左右滑动的 View，如网易新闻客户端，可以左右滑动，在不同的新闻栏目之间进行切换；有时候我们也需要实现一些 Tab，如果 Tab 的项目比较多，也需要考虑复用的问题，所以决定重新写一个增强组件，作为其替代品，所以就产生了 KIPageView。","homepage":"https://github.com/smartwalle/KIPageView","license":"MIT","authors":{"SmartWalle":"smartwalle@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":null},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/smartwalle/KIPageView.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":"KIPageView/KIPageView/*.{h,m}","exclude_files":"Classes/Exclude","requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
