Hello(sender: self.this)\n    case is Hello:\n      print(\"got Hello\")\n    default:\n      print(\"what?\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAll messages must subclass Message:\n```swift\n\npublic class Hi : Message {}\n \npublic class Hello : Message {}\n\n```\n\nActors live inside an actor system, theater provides a default system\n\n```swift\n  let system : ActorSystem = AppActorSystem.shared\n```\n\nPutting in all together:\n\n```swift\nimport Theater\n \npublic class Hi : Message {}\n \npublic class Hello : Message {}\n \npublic class Dude : Actor {\n    override public func receive(msg : Message) -> Void {\n        switch (msg) {\n            case let m as Hi:\n                m.sender! !
