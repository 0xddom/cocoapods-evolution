Ao passar por cima de alguma view, como um botão, ele pode usar gestos para ativar aquela ação.\n  Temos quatro tipos de gestos: Piscar olho direito; piscar olho esquerdo; mostrar a língua ou com um comando de voz. Esse comando de voz pode receber quatro ações, a primeira é de toque em algo, segundo de voltar\n  na navegação com navigationcontroller, o de próximo e de anterior, para usar em views que tem scroll, como celular e collectionsviews. Para demais ações, deve-se integrar componentes que possam facilitar na hora da utilização\n  da aplicação.\n  A ação com voz ainda está em fase de testes. O mais recomendado é o da língua, pois tiveram os melhores resultados, diminuindo assim o esforço repetitivo.\n  Para utilizar basta mudar a herança de uma classe que herda da viewcontroller  pela AccessibilityFaceAnchorViewController e iniciar os recursos necessarios.\n  Para uma melhor utilização do usuário existe a classe AcessibilityGetSensitivityViewController, que tem função de capturar as limitações da face do usuário e assim se adequando ao seu ritmo.","homepage":"https://github.com/JBatista1/AcessibilityFace.git","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"João Batista":"j.batista.damasceno@icloud.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/JBatista1/AcessibilityFace.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"13.0"},"source_files":"Source/**/*.swift","migrated":true}

A VIPERS application uses an object conforming to the WireframeProtocol to route between the controllers of your app.\n\nIt is the powerful thing that wires the view controllers in your app together. It takes an NSURL and some parameters, talks to the components that create your view controllers (the ControllerProvider) which create the view controller connected to this URL, and gives it to those components which are responsible for presenting your controller (the ControllerRoutingPresenter).\n\nThe wireframe is responsible for navigating to the next view controller and communicates and connects all objects of the wireframe layer. It is used by the presenter layer to navigate to the next view controller. We recommend you to avoid using it in a view controller which is located in the view layer. It is better to call it from a delegate.","homepage":"https://github.com/VIPER-Swift/VIPERS-Wireframe-Protocol","license":"MIT","authors":{"Jan Bartel":"barteljan@yahoo.de"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/VIPER-Swift/VIPERS-Wireframe-Protocol.git","tag":"0.1.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Pod/Classes/**/*","resource_bundles":{"VISPERS-Wireframe-Protocol":["Pod/Assets/*.png"]},"migrated":true}

It was inspired by RapidXml.\n\nRapidJSON is small but complete. It supports both SAX and DOM style API. The SAX parser is only a half thousand lines of code.\nRapidJSON is fast. Its performance can be comparable to strlen(). It also optionally supports SSE2/SSE4.2 for acceleration.\nRapidJSON is self-contained and header-only. It does not depend on external libraries such as BOOST. It even does not depend on STL.\nRapidJSON is memory-friendly. Each JSON value occupies exactly 16 bytes for most 32/64-bit machines (excluding text string). By default it uses a fast memory allocator, and the parser allocates memory compactly during parsing.\nRapidJSON is Unicode-friendly. It supports UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 (LE & BE), and their detection, validation and transcoding internally. For example, you can read a UTF-8 file and let RapidJSON transcode the JSON strings into UTF-16 in the DOM. It also supports surrogates and \"\u0000\" (null character).","homepage":"http://rapidjson.org/","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"license.txt"},"authors":"Milo Yip","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson.git","tag":"version1.1.0"},"source_files":"include/rapidjson/**/*.h","header_mappings_dir":"include/rapidjson","requires_arc":false,"migrated":true}
