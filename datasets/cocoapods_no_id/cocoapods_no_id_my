The AsyncImageView operates independently of the UIImage cache, but by default any images located in the root of the application bundle will be stored in the UIImage cache instead, avoiding any duplication of cached images.\n\nThe library can also be used to load and cache images independently of a UIImageView as it provides direct access to the underlying loading and caching classes.","homepage":"http://charcoaldesign.co.uk/source/cocoa#asyncimageview","license":{"type":"zlib","file":"LICENCE.md"},"authors":{"Fraser Scott-Morrison":"fraserscottmorrison@me.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/IdleHandsApps/AsyncImageView.git","tag":"1.5.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"4.3"},"source_files":"AsyncImageView","requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
