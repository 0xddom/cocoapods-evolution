For each animation\nyou provide a closure which is called repeatedly with a progress value, and from here\nyou can set whatever properties you want. You're not restricted to the 'animatable'\nproperties, and you can use the helper curve classes and interpolation operators to\nmake your code very small, clear, and concise. With the curve classes, you can\nconstruct custom curves and use them to control the motion of your animations as a\nsingle fire-and-forget call to trigger the animation, instead of chaining together\nsecondary and tiertary animations from the completion blocks.\n\nIn addition to the triggerable animations, you can adopt the Animatable protocol in\nany of your classes, and add them to start receiving updates. This allows you to get\nconstant callbacks in sync with the screen refresh, so that you can apply any motion\neffects you want. You can remove your Animatable so that it no longer receives\nupdates at any time, but if you forget to remove it don't worry - the Animation\nframework only keeps a weak reference to it, and will automatically remove it when\nyour instance goes away.","homepage":"https://github.com/j-h-a/Animation","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE.md"},"authors":"Jay Abbott","platforms":{"ios":"10.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/j-h-a/Animation.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"source_files":"Animation","migrated":true}
