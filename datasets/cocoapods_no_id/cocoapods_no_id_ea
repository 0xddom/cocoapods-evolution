{"name":"HBStatusBarNotification","version":"1.0.1","summary":"An extremely lightweight solution to dispatching status bar notifications from anywhere in your iOS application.","description":"HBStatusBarNotification provides a simple one-liner for dispatching a text-based notification that will overlay the status bar for a short duration. It offers a range of customization options so that you can make the notification appear however you would like it to.\n\n    I made this because it's something a lot of iOS developers want in their application, but I found a lot of the existing options require more code and offer less customization. I wanted a solution that looked like it came from the same developer and wasn't obviously a library that I had dragged into my project.","homepage":"https://github.com/havenbarnes/HBStatusBarNotification","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"havenbarnes":"haven38@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/havenbarnes/HBStatusBarNotification.git","tag":"1.0.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"HBStatusBarNotification/Classes/**/*","pushed_with_swift_version":"3.0","migrated":true}
