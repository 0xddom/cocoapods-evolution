ParseKit is suitable for use on Mac OS X Leopard,\n    Snow Leopard or iOS. ParseKit is an Objective-C implementation\n    of the tools described in Building Parsers with Java by Steven\n    John Metsker.\n\n    ParseKit includes additional features beyond the\n    designs from the book and also some changes to match common\n    Cocoa/Objective-C conventions. These changes are relatively superficial,\n    however, and Metsker’s book is the best documentation available\n    for ParseKit.\n  ","source_files":["include/**/*.{h,m}","src/**/*.{h,m}","lib/MGTemplateEngine/MGTemplate*.{h,m}","lib/MGTemplateEngine/ICUTemplateMatcher.{h,m}","lib/MGTemplateEngine/*DeepMutableCopy.{h,m}"],"exclude_files":"src/PKSParserGenVisitor.{h,m}","ios":{"prefix_header_file":"src/ParseKitMobile_Prefix.pch","frameworks":"Foundation"},"osx":{"prefix_header_file":"src/ParseKit_Prefix.pch","frameworks":"Foundation"},"libraries":"icucore","requires_arc":false,"migrated":true}
