{"name":"Simplify-Swift","version":"1.0.0","summary":"A high performance Swift 2D/3D polyline simplification library","description":"Simplify-Swift is a high-performance Swift polyline simplification library ported from Simplify.js. The original Javascript library was extracted from Leaflet, a JS interactive maps library by Vladimir Agafonkin. It uses a combination of Douglas-Peucker and Radial Distance algorithms. Polyline simplification dramatically reduces the number of points in a polyline while retaining its shape, giving a huge performance boost when processing it and also reducing visual noise.","homepage":"https://github.com/tomislav/Simplify-Swift","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Tomislav Filipcic":"tf@7sols.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tomislav/Simplify-Swift.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/tomislav","platforms":{"ios":"9.3"},"source_files":"Simplify-Swift/Classes/**/*","swift_version":"4.2","migrated":true}
