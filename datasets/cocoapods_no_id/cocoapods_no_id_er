Call [LTHPasscodeViewController useKeychain:NO], but only implement -savePasscode:\n```\n\n* Open as a modal, or pushed for changing, enabling or disabling the passcode:\n\n```objc\n/**\n @param\tviewController The view controller where the passcode view controller will be displayed.\n @param asModal        Set to YES to present as a modal, or to NO to push on the current nav stack.\n */\n- (void)showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController asModal:(BOOL)isModal;\n- (void)showForDisablingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController asModal:(BOOL)isModal;\n- (void)showForChangingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController asModal:(BOOL)isModal;\n```\n\n* Show the lock screen:\n\n```objc\n- (void)showLockScreenWithAnimation:(BOOL)animated withLogout:(BOOL)hasLogout andLogoutTitle:(NSString*)logoutTitle;\n\n// Example:\n[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showLockscreenWithAnimation:YES withLogout:NO andLogoutTitle:nil];\n// Displayed with a slide up animation, which, combined with \n// the keyboard sliding down animation, creates an \"unlocking\" impression.\n```\n\n* entering foreground and resigning is handled from within the class. \n\n\nMakes use of [SFHFKeyChainUtils](https://github.com/ldandersen/scifihifi-iphone) to save the passcode in the Keychain.

Supports custom saving, by calling `[LTHPasscodeViewController useKeychain:NO]` after initializing and implementing a few protocol methods (the same names the library uses for the same job):\n\n```objc\n- (void)passcodeViewControllerWillClose;\n- (void)maxNumberOfFailedAttemptsReached;\n- (void)passcodeWasEnteredSuccessfully;\n- (void)logoutButtonWasPressed;\n- (NSTimeInterval)timerDuration;\n- (void)saveTimerDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration;\n- (NSTimeInterval)timerStartTime;\n- (void)saveTimerStartTime;\n- (BOOL)didPasscodeTimerEnd;\n- (void)deletePasscode;\n- (void)savePasscode:(NSString *)passcode;\n- (NSString *)passcode;\n// All of them fall back on the Keychain if they are not implemented, even if [LTHPasscodeViewController useKeychain:NO] was called, for flexibility over what and where you save. \n// Do you only want to save the passcode in a different location and leave everything else in the Keychain? Call [LTHPasscodeViewController useKeychain:NO], but only implement -savePasscode:\n```\n\n* Open as a modal, or pushed for changing, enabling or disabling the passcode:\n\n```objc\n/**\n @param\tviewController The view controller where the passcode view controller will be displayed.\n @param asModal        Set to YES to present as a modal, or to NO to push on the current nav stack.\n */\n- (void)showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController asModal:(BOOL)isModal;\n- (void)showForDisablingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController asModal:(BOOL)isModal;\n- (void)showForChangingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController asModal:(BOOL)isModal;\n```\n\n* Show the lock screen:\n\n```objc\n- (void)showLockScreenWithAnimation:(BOOL)animated withLogout:(BOOL)hasLogout andLogoutTitle:(NSString*)logoutTitle;\n\n// Example:\n[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showLockscreenWithAnimation:YES withLogout:NO andLogoutTitle:nil];\n// Displayed with a slide up animation, which, combined with \n// the keyboard sliding down animation, creates an \"unlocking\" impression.\n```\n\n* entering foreground and resigning is handled from within the class. \n\n\nMakes use of [SFHFKeyChainUtils](https://github.com/ldandersen/scifihifi-iphone) to save the passcode in the Keychain. I know he dropped support for it, but I updated it for ARC 2 years ago ([with help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7663443/sfhfkeychainutils-ios-keychain-arc-compatible)) and I kept using it since. The 'new' version isn't updated to ARC anyway, so I saw no reason to switch to it, or to any other library.\n\nFeel free to [contact me](mailto:roland@rolandleth.com), or open an issue if anything is unclear, bugged, or can be improved. \n\n![Screenshot](http://rolandleth.com/assets/ios7-style-passcode/screenshot.png)   ![Screenshot](http://rolandleth.com/assets/ios7-style-passcode/change-passcode-screenshot.png)\n\n# Apps using this control\n[Expenses Planner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expenses-planner-reminders/id669431471?mt=8), [DigitalOcean Manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/digitalocean-manager/id633128302?mt=8), [LovelyHeroku](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lovelyheroku/id706287663?mt=8&uo=4), [Flow Web Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flow-web-browser-downloader/id705536564?mt=8), [Balance - Checkbook App](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id854362248), [QIF Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qif-reader/id374178932?mt=8), [Zee - Personal Finance](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zee-personal-finance/id422694086?mt=8), [EZDiary](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ezdiary-my-diary/id1128083826?ls=1&mt=8).\n\nIf you're using this control, I'd love hearing from you!  \n\n# License\nLicensed under MIT.

Not the Lock Screen one, but the one you get in Settings when changing your passcode.\nI made it a singleton because if the lock is active, when leaving the app a view must be placed on top, so no data from within the app can be seen in the multitasking mode. This is done under the hood, without having to do anything extra.\n# How to use\nDrag the contents of `LTHPasscodeViewController` to your project, or add `pod 'LTHPasscodeViewController'` to your podspec file.\n* When opened from Settings (as a modal):\n```objc\n- (void)showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;\n- (void)showForChangingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;\n- (void)showForTurningOffPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;\n// Example:\n[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController: self]\n```\n* At app launch, or whenever you'd like the user to be shown a passcode entry:\n```objc\n- (void)showLockscreenWithAnimation:(BOOL)animated;\n// Example:\n[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showLockscreenWithAnimation: YES]\n// Displayed with a slide up animation, which, combined with\n// the keyboard sliding down animation, creates an \"unlocking\" impression.\n```\n* entering foreground and resigning is handled from within the class.\nEverything is easily customizable with macros and static constants.\nMakes use of [SFHFKeyChainUtils](https://github.com/ldandersen/scifihifi-iphone) to save the passcode in the Keychain. I know he dropped support for it, but I updated it for ARC 2 years ago ([with help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7663443/sfhfkeychainutils-ios-keychain-arc-compatible)) and I kept using it since. The 'new' version isn't updated to ARC anyway, so I saw no reason to switch to it, or to any other library.\nRather than writing a big documentation, I heavily commented it as best as I could. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:roland@rolandleth.com), or open an issue if anything is unclear, bugged, or can be improved.\n## Removing Unused Localizations\nBecause the App Store automatically attempts to determine supported locales, and LTHPasscodeViewController includes localizations for the aforementioned locales, you may want to remove the `.strings` file and `.lproj` directory.

Not the Lock Screen one, but the one you get in Settings when changing your passcode.\nI made it a singleton because if the lock is active, when leaving the app a view must be placed on top, so no data from within the app can be seen in the multitasking mode. This is done under the hood, without having to do anything extra.\n# How to use\nDrag the contents of `LTHPasscodeViewController` to your project, or add `pod 'LTHPasscodeViewController'` to your podspec file.\n* When opened from Settings (as a modal):\n```objc\n- (void)showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;\n- (void)showForChangingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;\n- (void)showForTurningOffPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;\n// Example:\n[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController: self]\n```\n* At app launch, or whenever you'd like the user to be shown a passcode entry:\n```objc\n- (void)showLockscreenWithAnimation:(BOOL)animated;\n// Example:\n[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showLockscreenWithAnimation: YES]\n// Displayed with a slide up animation, which, combined with\n// the keyboard sliding down animation, creates an \"unlocking\" impression.\n```\n* entering foreground and resigning is handled from within the class.\nEverything is easily customizable with macros and static constants.\nMakes use of [SFHFKeyChainUtils](https://github.com/ldandersen/scifihifi-iphone) to save the passcode in the Keychain. I know he dropped support for it, but I updated it for ARC 2 years ago ([with help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7663443/sfhfkeychainutils-ios-keychain-arc-compatible)) and I kept using it since. The 'new' version isn't updated to ARC anyway, so I saw no reason to switch to it, or to any other library.\nRather than writing a big documentation, I heavily commented it as best as I could. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:roland@rolandleth.com), or open an issue if anything is unclear, bugged, or can be improved.\n## Removing Unused Localizations\nBecause the App Store automatically attempts to determine supported locales, and LTHPasscodeViewController includes localizations for the aforementioned locales, you may want to remove the `.strings` file and `.lproj` directory. You can do this most easily by having the following command run in a new Build Phase:\n        $ find \"$TARGET_BUILD_DIR\" -maxdepth 8 -type f -name \"LTHPasscodeViewController.strings\" -execdir rm -r -v {} ;\n# Apps using this control\n[Expenses Planner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expenses-planner-reminders/id669431471?mt=8)\n[DigitalOcean Manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/digitalocean-manager/id633128302?mt=8)\n[LovelyHeroku](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lovelyheroku/id706287663?mt=8&uo=4)\n[Flow Web Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flow-web-browser-downloader/id705536564?mt=8)\n[Balance - Checkbook App](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id854362248)\nIf you're using this control, I'd love hearing from you!","migrated":true}

I have not yet built an OKScript translator, but that could quite easily be done if there is demand.\n\n## Key Features\n\n  - Provides support for scanning strings\n  - Provides support for defining scanning (terminal) and parsing rules\n  - Fully supports direct and indirect left hand recursion in rules\n  - Provides support for parsing strings using defined rules as streams of tokens or constructing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)\n  - All of the above provided as implementations of protocols allowing the replacement of any by your own components if you wish\n  - Create your own file decoders (using Swift 4's Encoding/Decoding framework `Encodable` and `Decodable`)\n  - A lexical analysis and parser definition language, STLR, which can be compiled at run-time in memory, or from stored files\n  - Complied STLR can be used immediately at run time, or through the generation of a Swift source file\n\n## Status\n\n  - All standard tests are passing\n  - Performance tests need some tidy up with 2 failing\n  - Some example products will be added shortly to provide some concrete usage examples","homepage":"http://www.swift-studies.com/oysterkit","license":"BSD 2-Clause License","authors":"RED When Excited","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/SwiftStudies/OysterKit.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"source_files":"Sources/OysterKit/**/*.swift","pushed_with_swift_version":"4.0","migrated":true}
