A possible response to \"My mother hates me\" would be \"Who else in your family hates you?\".\nELIZA was implemented using simple pattern matching techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked.\nIt was one of the first chatterbots.","homepage":"https://github.com/SwiftArchitect/Eliza","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Xavier Schott":"http://swiftarchitect.com/swiftarchitect/"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source":{"git":"https://github.com/SwiftArchitect/Eliza.git","tag":"v1.0.0"},"exclude_files":"*.txt","source_files":"Eliza/*.{h,m}","public_header_files":"Eliza/**/*.h","frameworks":"UIKit","migrated":true}
