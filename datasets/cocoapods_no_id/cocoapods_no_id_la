These operators are mostly intended for unit/integration tests\nwith a couple of other special scenarios where they could be useful.\nE.g.\nWaiting for observable sequence to complete before exiting command line application.\n\nRxTests: (see [RxSwift/RxTests](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxTests))\nUnit testing extensions for RxObjC. This library contains mock schedulers, observables, and observers\nthat should make unit testing your operators easy as unit testing RxObjC built-in operators.\nThis library contains everything you needed to write unit tests in the following way:\n```\n- (void)testMap {\n    RxTestScheduler *scheduler = [[RxTestScheduler alloc] initWithInitialClock:0];\n\n    RxTestableObservable *xs = [scheduler createHotObservable:@[\n            next(150, @1),\n            next(210, @0),\n            next(220, @1),\n            next(230, @2),\n            next(240, @4),\n            completed(300)\n    ]];\n\n    RxTestableObserver *res = [scheduler startWithObservable:[xs map:^NSNumber *(NSNumber *o) {\n        return @(o.integerValue * 2);\n    }]];\n\n    NSArray *events = @[\n            next(210, @(0 * 2)),\n            next(220, @(1 * 2)),\n            next(230, @(2 * 2)),\n            next(240, @(4 * 2)),\n            completed(300),\n    ];\n    XCTAssertEqualObjects(res.events, events);\n\n    XCTAssertEqualObjects(xs.subscriptions, @[\n            Subscription(200, 300)\n    ]);\n}\n```\n\n```","homepage":"https://github.com/pasha010/RxObjC","license":"MIT","authors":{"Pavel Malkov":"mpa026@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/pasha010/RxObjC.git","tag":"1.1.1"},"requires_arc":true,"platforms":{"ios":"8.0","osx":"10.9","watchos":"2.0","tvos":"9.0"},"subspecs":[{"name":"Core","public_header_files":["RxObjC/*.h","RxObjC/Concurrency/*.h","RxObjC/DataStructures/*.h","RxObjC/Disposables/*.h","RxObjC/Extensions/*.h","RxObjC/Observables/*.h","RxObjC/Observables/Implementations/*.h","RxObjC/Observers/*.h","RxObjC/Platform/*.h","RxObjC/Schedulers/*.h","RxObjC/Schedulers/Internal/*.h","RxObjC/Subjects/*.h"],"source_files":["RxObjC/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Concurrency/*{h,m}","RxObjC/DataStructures/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Disposables/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Extensions/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Observables/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Observables/Implementations/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Observers/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Platform/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Schedulers/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Schedulers/Internal/*{h,m}","RxObjC/Subjects/*{h,m}"]},{"name":"RxBlocking","dependencies":{"RxObjC/Core":[]},"source_files":"RxBlocking/*.{h,m}","public_header_files":"RxBlocking/*.h"},{"name":"RxCocoa","dependencies":{"RxObjC/Core":[]},"source_files":["RxCocoa/RxCocoa.h","RxCocoa/Common/*{h,m}","RxCocoa/Common/Observables/*{h,m}","RxCocoa/Common/Observables/Implementations/*{h,m}"],"public_header_files":["RxCocoa/RxCocoa.h","RxCocoa/Common/*.h","RxCocoa/Common/Observables/*.h","RxCocoa/Common/Observables/Implementations/*.h"]},{"name":"RxTests","dependencies":{"RxObjC/Core":[]},"source_files":"RxTests/**/*.{h,m}","public_header_files":"RxTests/**/*.h","platforms":{"ios":"8.0","osx":"10.9","tvos":"9.0"}}],"migrated":true}
