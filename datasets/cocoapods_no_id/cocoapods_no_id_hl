HugeFiles=on\n- UTF8 support.\n- Extra compression/decompression functionality of single NSData object with Lzma2.","homepage":"https://github.com/OlehKulykov/LzmaSDKObjC","license":"MIT","authors":{"OlehKulykov":"info@resident.name"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/OlehKulykov/LzmaSDKObjC.git","tag":"2.1.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0","osx":"10.9"},"requires_arc":true,"public_header_files":["src/LzmaSDKObjCTypes.h","src/LzmaSDKObjCExtern.h","src/LzmaSDKObjCReader.h","src/LzmaSDKObjCWriter.h","src/LzmaSDKObjCItem.h","src/LzmaSDKObjCMutableItem.h","src/LzmaSDKObjCBufferProcessor.h","src/LzmaSDKObjCCrc.h","src/LzmaSDKObjC.h"],"source_files":["src/*.{h,cpp,mm}","lzma/C/*.{h}","lzma/C/7zCrc.c","lzma/C/7zCrcOpt.c","lzma/C/7zStream.c","lzma/C/Aes.c","lzma/C/AesOpt.c","lzma/C/Alloc.c","lzma/C/Bcj2.c","lzma/C/Bcj2Enc.c","lzma/C/Bra.c","lzma/C/Bra86.c","lzma/C/BraIA64.c","lzma/C/CpuArch.c","lzma/C/Delta.c","lzma/C/LzFind.c","lzma/C/LzFindMt.c","lzma/C/Lzma2Dec.c","lzma/C/Lzma2DecMt.c","lzma/C/Lzma2Enc.c","lzma/C/LzmaDec.c","lzma/C/LzmaEnc.c","lzma/C/MtCoder.c","lzma/C/Ppmd7.c","lzma/C/Ppmd7Dec.c","lzma/C/Ppmd7Enc.c","lzma/C/Sha256.c","lzma/C/Threads.c","lzma/C/Xz.c","lzma/C/XzCrc64.c","lzma/C/XzCrc64Opt.c","lzma/C/XzDec.c","lzma/C/XzEnc.c","lzma/C/XzIn.c","lzma/CPP/7zip/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zDecode.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zEncode.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zExtract.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zFolderInStream.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zHandler.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zHandlerOut.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zHeader.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zIn.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zOut.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zProperties.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zRegister.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zSpecStream.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zUpdate.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/ArchiveExports.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/Common/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/Common/CoderMixer2.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/Common/DummyOutStream.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/Common/HandlerOut.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/Common/ItemNameUtils.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/Common/OutStreamWithCRC.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/DllExports2.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Archive/LzmaHandler.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/CreateCoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/CWrappers.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/FileStreams.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/FilterCoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/InOutTempBuffer.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/LimitedStreams.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/LockedStream.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/MethodProps.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/OutBuffer.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/ProgressUtils.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/PropId.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/StreamBinder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/StreamObjects.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/StreamUtils.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Common/VirtThread.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/Bcj2Coder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/Bcj2Register.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/BcjCoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/BcjRegister.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/BranchMisc.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/BranchRegister.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/ByteSwap.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/CodecExports.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/CopyCoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/CopyRegister.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/Lzma2Decoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/Lzma2Encoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/Lzma2Register.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/LzmaDecoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/LzmaEncoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/LzmaRegister.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/PpmdDecoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/PpmdEncoder.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Compress/PpmdRegister.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Crypto/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/7zip/Crypto/7zAes.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Crypto/7zAesRegister.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Crypto/MyAes.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Crypto/MyAesReg.cpp","lzma/CPP/7zip/Crypto/RandGen.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/Common/C_FileIO.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/CrcReg.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/IntToString.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/MyString.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/MyWindows.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/Sha256Reg.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/StringConvert.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/StringToInt.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/Wildcard.cpp","lzma/CPP/Common/XzCrc64Reg.cpp","lzma/CPP/Windows/*.{h}","lzma/CPP/Windows/PropVariant.cpp","lzma/CPP/Windows/PropVariantConv.cpp"],"compiler_flags":["-DLZMASDKOBJC=1","-DLZMASDKOBJC_OMIT_UNUSED_CODE=1"],"libraries":"c++","migrated":true}
