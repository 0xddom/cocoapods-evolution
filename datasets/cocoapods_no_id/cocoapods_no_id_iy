To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'PMOSurvey'\n```\n### Step 2: Configure Firebase Config\n\nOn the Firebase console navigation bar, click Remote Config. Add a parameter or choose a parameter to edit:\n\nTo add a parameter: Click Add Parameter.\nTo edit a parameter: Click the parameter you want to change.\n\n```json format\n{\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"question\": \"Where are you from?\",\n  \"options\": [\n    \"Konya\",\n    \"Izmir\",\n    \"Istanbul\",\n    \"Ankara\",\n    \"Edirne\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n<img src=https://github.com/plus-minus-one/PMOSurvey/blob/main/images/image_firebase.png />\n\n### Step 3: Integrate the PMOSurvey SDK with your app\n\n1. Import the SDK\n```swift\nimport PMOSurvey\n```\n\n2. Initialize the SDK with survey properties:\n```swift\n\nvar prop = PMOSurveyProperties()\nprop.plist_key = \"pmo_survey\"\nprop.duration = 10\nprop.enable_button_color = UIColor.green\nprop.disable_button_color = UIColor.red\nPMOSurvey.configure(prop)\n```\n3. Presenting a Survey to the User\n  \n```swift\nPMOSurvey.shared.isActive { [weak self] (active) in\nguard let strongSelf = self else { return }\n  if active{\n     PMOSurvey.shared.show(strongSelf, delegate: strongSelf)\n  }\n}\n``` \n4. Delegation : The survey respondent data is returned as an PMORespondent. Here's an example:\n  \n```swift\nextension ViewController:PMOSurveyDelegate{\n    func respondentDidEndSurvey(_ response: PMORespondent?, error: Error?) {\n        if let res = response{\n            print(\"question: \" + res.question)\n            print(\"answer: \" + res.answer)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","homepage":"https://github.com/plus-minus-one/PMOSurvey","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"ahmet":"ahmet@plusminusone.co"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/plus-minus-one/PMOSurvey.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"PMOSurvey/Classes/**/*","static_framework":true,"dependencies":{"Firebase/RemoteConfig":[]},"swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}
