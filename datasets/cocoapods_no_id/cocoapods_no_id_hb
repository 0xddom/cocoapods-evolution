{"name":"KIKeyChain","version":"0.0.1","summary":"KIKeyChain","description":"## KIKeyChain\n\n在 iOS 应用程序开发过程中，我们经常会存储一些比较重要的信息。比如涉及到用户系统的 App, 我们就需要考虑自动登录的功能，如果把用户的用户名和密码存储在 NSUserDefault 中，会很不安全。第一，该信息是明文存储的；第二，可以通过一些工具获取到 NSUserDefault 中的信息。这样就很容易泄露用户的账号信息，这当然是我们不愿意看到的。\n\n出于安全方面的考虑，Apple 为我们提供了一个叫 KeyChain 的工具, 存储在里面的信息不能说绝对安全，但是相对于 NSUserDefault 或者其它一些存储在 App 沙盒中的信息，其要安全很多。第一，KeyChain 的存储位置位于 /private/var/Keychains/... ，如果我们要直接访问里面的信息，必须要先越狱之后才能访问；第二，KeyChain 的关键信息都是经过加密处理的，所以就算获取到之后也还需要做破解工作。\n\n网上有很多关于 KeyChain 的访问组件，Apple 也提供了相应的 [Demo](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/GenericKeychain/Introduction/Intro.html)。但是，感觉不怎么实用，操作起来相对麻烦。所以决定自己对其重新进行封装，然后就有了这个 KIKeyChain 这个组件。\n\n使用方法如下：\n\n写入数据：\n\n    KIKeyChain *key = [KIKeyChain keyChainWithIdentifier:@\"default_user\"];\n    [key setValue:@\"user1\" forKey:@\"username\"];\n    [key setValue:@\"password1\" forKey:@\"password\"];\n    [key write];\n\n读取数据：\n\n    KIKeyChain *key = [KIKeyChain keyChainWithIdentifier:@\"default_user\"];\n    NSLog(@\"%@==%@\", [key valueForKey:@\"username\"], [key valueForKey:@\"password\"]);","homepage":"https://github.com/smartwalle/KIKeyChain","license":"MIT","authors":{"SmartWalle":"smartwalle@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":null},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/smartwalle/KIKeyChain.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":"KIKeyChain/KIKeyChain/*.{h,m}","frameworks":"Security","requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
