It is designed to help you interface with network activity events by allowing all object to pub and subscribe with reachability events. Based on Apples Reachability project.\n\n\n                        Supported iOS SDK Versions\n                        -----------------------------\n\n                        * Supported build target - iOS 7.0\n\n\n                        ARC Compatibility\n                        ------------------\n\n                        VCLReachability works both with ARC.\n\n\n                        Usage\n                        -----------------\n\n                        For application demo see ViewController and AppDelegate.\n\n                        Build and run the sample using Xcode. When running the iPhone Simulator, you can exercise the application by disconnecting the Ethernet cable, turning off AirPort, or by joining an ad-hoc local Wi-Fi network.\n\n                        See the example project and test for examples on how to use.\n\n                        IMPORTANT: VCLReachability must use DNS to resolve the host name before it can determine the VCLReachability of that host, and this may take time on certain network connections.  Because of this, the API will return NotReachable until name resolution has completed.  This delay may be visible in the interface on some networks.\n\n                        The VCLReachability sample demonstrates the asynchronous use of the SCNetworkReachability API. You can use the API synchronously, but do not issue a synchronous check by hostName on the main thread. If the device cannot reach a DNS server or is on a slow network, a synchronous call to the SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags function can block for up to 30 seconds trying to resolve the hostName. If this happens on the main thread, the application watchdog will kill the application after 20 seconds of inactivity.\n\n                        SCNetworkReachability API's do not currently provide a means to detect support for GameKit peer-to-peer networking over Bluetooth.\n\n\n                        Methods\n                        ----------------\n\n                        See VCLReachabilitySubscriber protocol.\n\n                        For quick use import `NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h`\n\n\n                        Release Notes\n                        ------------------\n\n                        Version 1.0.0\n\n                        - Initial release\n","homepage":"https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability","license":"MIT","authors":{"adrianmaurer":"adrian@verticodelabs.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability.git","tag":"1.0.1"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/verticodelabs","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Classes/**/*.{h,m}","ios":{"exclude_files":"Classes/osx"},"osx":{"exclude_files":"Classes/ios"},"migrated":true}

It is designed to help you interface with network activity events by allowing all objects to publish and subscribe to reachability events. \n\n                      Based on Apples [Reachability](https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/samplecode/Reachability/Introduction/Intro.html) project.\n\n                      ### Supported iOS SDK Versions\n\n                      * Supported build target - iOS 7.0\n\n                      ### ARC Compatibility\n\n                      VCLReachability works both with ARC.\n\n                      ## Table of contents\n\n                      - [Quick start](#quick-start)\n                      - [ChangeLog](#changelog)\n                      - [Documentation](#documentation)\n                      - [Bugs and feature requests](#bugs-and-feature-requests)\n                      - [Contributing](#contributing)\n                      - [Community](#community)\n                      - [Versioning](#versioning)\n                      - [Authors](#authors)\n                      - [License](#license)\n\n                      ## Quick start\n\n                      Four quick start options are available:\n\n                      - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability/releases) and add the source from `Classes` to your project.\n\n                      - Clone the repo and use the example project: \n                      ```bash\n                      git@github.com:VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability.git\n                      ```\n\n                      - Install with [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) by adding VCLReachability to your Podfile.\n                      ```bash\n                      pod `VCLReachability`\n                      ```\n\n                      ### What's included\n\n                      Within the download you'll find the following files, providing both compiled and minified variations:\n\n                      ```\n                      Classes/\n                      └── ios/\n                          ├── NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h\n                          └── NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.m\n                          └── VCLReachability.h\n                          └── VCLReachability.m\n                          └── VCLReachability.h\n                      Examples/\n                      ├── ...\n                      Tests/\n                      ├── ...\n                      VCLReachability.xcodeproj/\n                      ├── ...\n\n                      ```\n\n                      ### Sample Usage\n\n                      IMPORTANT: VCLReachability must use DNS to resolve the host name before it can determine the VCLReachability of that host, and this may take time on certain network connections.  Because of this, the API will return NotReachable until name resolution has completed.  This delay may be visible in the interface on some networks.\n\n                      The VCLReachability sample demonstrates the asynchronous use of the SCNetworkReachability API. You can use the API synchronously, but do not issue a synchronous check by hostName on the main thread. If the device cannot reach a DNS server or is on a slow network, a synchronous call to the SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags function can block for up to 30 seconds trying to resolve the hostName. If this happens on the main thread, the application watchdog will kill the application after 20 seconds of inactivity.\n\n                      SCNetworkReachability API's do not currently provide a means to detect support for GameKit peer-to-peer networking over Bluetooth.\n\n                      #### Using the VCLReachabilitySubscriber Protocol\n\n                      Add `VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h` to the class you which to become a reachability subscriber.\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      #import \"VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h\"\n                      ```\n                      Implement the protocol method\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      - (void)reachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      - (void)wifiReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      - (void)internetReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      - (void)hostNameReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      ```\n\n                      For example....\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      - (void)reachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note\n                      {\n                          VCLReachability* curReach = [note object];\n                          NSParameterAssert([curReach isKindOfClass:[VCLReachability class]]);\n                          \n                          [(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>)self updateWithReachability:curReach forType:nil];\n                      }\n                      ```\n\n                      #### Using the VCLReachability Category\n\n                      Add `NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h` to the class you which to become a reachability subscriber.\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      #import \"NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h\"\n                      ```\n\n                      The VCLReachabilitySubscriber protocol methods will aready be filled in. By default every subscriber will execute `- (void)updateWithReachability:(VCLReachability *)reachability forType:(NSString*)type;` unless the other optional protocol methods are defined. Be sure to define `updateWithReachability` in your subscriber.\n\n                      #### Subscribe to Network Events\n\n                      The following methods are used to subscribe to differente reachability events.\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      /*!\n                       * Subscribe change it network events\n                       */\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityNotificationsWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForWifiWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForHostNameWithName:(NSString *)hostName delegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForInternetConnectionWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      ```\n\n                      For example...\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      - (void)viewDidLoad\n                      {  \n                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForHostNameWithName:@\"google.com\" delegate:self];\n                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForInternetConnectionWithDelegate:self];\n                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForWifiWithDelegate:self];\n                      }\n                      ```\n\n                      ## ChangeLog\n                      Refer to the [releases](https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability/releases) section for a detailed ChangeLog\n\n                      <!-- ## Documentation\n\n                      Refer to [vclreachability.readthedocs.org](http://vclreachability.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for detailed API documentation. -->\n\n                      ## Bugs and feature requests\n\n                      Have a bug or a feature request?

It is designed to help you interface with network activity events by allowing all objects to publish and subscribe to reachability events. \n\n                      Based on Apples [Reachability](https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/samplecode/Reachability/Introduction/Intro.html) project.\n\n                      ### Supported iOS SDK Versions\n\n                      * Supported build target - iOS 7.0\n\n                      ### ARC Compatibility\n\n                      VCLReachability works both with ARC.\n\n                      ## Table of contents\n\n                      - [Quick start](#quick-start)\n                      - [ChangeLog](#changelog)\n                      - [Documentation](#documentation)\n                      - [Bugs and feature requests](#bugs-and-feature-requests)\n                      - [Contributing](#contributing)\n                      - [Community](#community)\n                      - [Versioning](#versioning)\n                      - [Authors](#authors)\n                      - [License](#license)\n\n                      ## Quick start\n\n                      Four quick start options are available:\n\n                      - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability/releases) and add the source from `Classes` to your project.\n\n                      - Clone the repo and use the example project: \n                      ```bash\n                      git@github.com:VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability.git\n                      ```\n\n                      - Install with [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) by adding VCLReachability to your Podfile.\n                      ```bash\n                      pod `VCLReachability`\n                      ```\n\n                      ### What's included\n\n                      Within the download you'll find the following files, providing both compiled and minified variations:\n\n                      ```\n                      Classes/\n                      └── ios/\n                          ├── NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h\n                          └── NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.m\n                          └── VCLReachability.h\n                          └── VCLReachability.m\n                          └── VCLReachability.h\n                      Examples/\n                      ├── ...\n                      Tests/\n                      ├── ...\n                      VCLReachability.xcodeproj/\n                      ├── ...\n\n                      ```\n\n                      ### Sample Usage\n\n                      IMPORTANT: VCLReachability must use DNS to resolve the host name before it can determine the VCLReachability of that host, and this may take time on certain network connections.  Because of this, the API will return NotReachable until name resolution has completed.  This delay may be visible in the interface on some networks.\n\n                      The VCLReachability sample demonstrates the asynchronous use of the SCNetworkReachability API. You can use the API synchronously, but do not issue a synchronous check by hostName on the main thread. If the device cannot reach a DNS server or is on a slow network, a synchronous call to the SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags function can block for up to 30 seconds trying to resolve the hostName. If this happens on the main thread, the application watchdog will kill the application after 20 seconds of inactivity.\n\n                      SCNetworkReachability API's do not currently provide a means to detect support for GameKit peer-to-peer networking over Bluetooth.\n\n                      #### Using the VCLReachabilitySubscriber Protocol\n\n                      Add `VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h` to the class you which to become a reachability subscriber.\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      #import \"VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h\"\n                      ```\n                      Implement the protocol method\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      - (void)reachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      - (void)wifiReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      - (void)internetReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      - (void)hostNameReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}\n                      ```\n\n                      For example....\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      - (void)reachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note\n                      {\n                          VCLReachability* curReach = [note object];\n                          NSParameterAssert([curReach isKindOfClass:[VCLReachability class]]);\n                          \n                          [(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>)self updateWithReachability:curReach forType:nil];\n                      }\n                      ```\n\n                      #### Using the VCLReachability Category\n\n                      Add `NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h` to the class you which to become a reachability subscriber.\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      #import \"NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h\"\n                      ```\n\n                      The VCLReachabilitySubscriber protocol methods will aready be filled in. By default every subscriber will execute `- (void)updateWithReachability:(VCLReachability *)reachability forType:(NSString*)type;` unless the other optional protocol methods are defined. Be sure to define `updateWithReachability` in your subscriber.\n\n                      #### Subscribe to Network Events\n\n                      The following methods are used to subscribe to differente reachability events.\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      /*!\n                       * Subscribe change it network events\n                       */\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityNotificationsWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForWifiWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForHostNameWithName:(NSString *)hostName delegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForInternetConnectionWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;\n                      ```\n\n                      For example...\n\n                      ```objective-c\n                      - (void)viewDidLoad\n                      {  \n                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForHostNameWithName:@\"google.com\" delegate:self];\n                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForInternetConnectionWithDelegate:self];\n                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForWifiWithDelegate:self];\n                      }\n                      ```\n                      **NOTE**\n                      Make sure you unsubscribe your delegates before they go bad by using the VCLReachability classes unsubscribe methods. I suggest that you do this within `dealloc`.\n\n                      ## ChangeLog\n                      Refer to the [releases](https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability/releases) section for a detailed ChangeLog\n\n                      <!-- ## Documentation\n\n                      Refer to [vclreachability.readthedocs.org](http://vclreachability.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for detailed API documentation. -->\n\n                      ## Bugs and feature requests\n\n                      Have a bug or a feature request?
