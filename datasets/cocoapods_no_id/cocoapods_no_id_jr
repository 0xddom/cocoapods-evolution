It'll work well on shared code between iOS and Mac projects without you needing to alter code to accomodate either individually.'\n\n            ## Usage\n            Get the colors from a `UIColor`or `NSColor` from any of your favourite color pickers. And from there you:\n\n            ```objc\n            // iOS\n            #import NSColor+EMIHexiColor.h\n            someViewYouWantToColor.backgroundColor = [AnyOSColor colorWithHexRGB:@\"FF9500\"];\n            ```\n            ```objc\n            // OS X\n            #import NSColor+EMIHexiColor.h\n            someViewYouWantToColor.backgroundColor = [AnyOSColor colorWithHexRGB:@\"FF0000\"];\n\n            ##How It Works\n\n            `AnyOSColor` is actually a macro that is handled at compile time. depending on what you're compiling for i.e. iOS or OSX, AnyOSColor ultimately renders to UIColor ot NSColor.\n\n            ##Caveats\n\n            Because this category was needed in a hurry, alot of the input string checking was skipped (i.e. the hex string checking). Feel free to update it and let me know so i can add it to the repo for others to enjoy too.\n\n            ##Caveats\n\n            There are two demo's apps with the code, both for OS X and iOS.\n\n            ### Version\n            1.0.5\n\n            ### Mentions\n            This grand bottle of wine that kept me sane this evening!\n","homepage":"https://github.com/emiscience/EMIHexiColor","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Adrian":"as@emiscience.com"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/emiscience","platforms":{"osx":null},"requires_arc":true,"source":{"git":"https://github.com/emiscience/EMIHexiColor.git","tag":"1.0.5"},"source_files":"EMIHexiColor","migrated":true}
