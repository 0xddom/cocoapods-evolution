At the time, I found very few comprehensive calendar libraries and as a result decided to build one. SSCalendar provides 3 different calendar views - an annual view, monthly view and weekly/daily view. Note that this calendar is not designed as a picker but rather to display an existing set of events.","homepage":"https://github.com/StevenPreston/SSCalendar","screenshots":["https://github.com/StevenPreston/SSCalendar/raw/master/Screenshots/1.gif","https://github.com/StevenPreston/SSCalendar/raw/master/Screenshots/2.gif","https://github.com/StevenPreston/SSCalendar/raw/master/Screenshots/3.gif"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Steven Preston":"stevenpreston@stellar16.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/StevenPreston/SSCalendar.git","tag":"0.0.3"},"social_media_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenpreston1","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"SSCalendar/Classes/**/*","resource_bundles":{"SSCalendar":["SSCalendar/Classes/**/*.xib"]},"migrated":true}

It supports a wide range of grammars thanks to its shift/reduce parsing schemes.  Currently CoreParse supports SLR, LR(1) and LALR(1) parsers.\n\n                      For full documentation see http://beelsebob.github.com/CoreParse.\n\n                      Why Should You use CoreParse\n                      ----------------------------\n\n                      You may wonder why and/or when you should use CoreParse.  There are already a number of parsers available in the wild, why should you use this one?\n\n                      * Compared to ParseKit:\n                        * CoreParse supports more languages (LR(1) languages cover all LL(1) languages and more).  In practice, LALR(1) grammars cover most useful languages.\n                        * CoreParse produces faster parsers.\n                        * CoreParse parsers and tokenisers can be archived using NSKeyedArchivers to save regenerating them each time your application runs.\n                        * CoreParse's parsing algorithm is not recursive, meaning it could theoretically deal with much larger hierarchies of language structure without blowing the stack.\n                      * Compared to lex/yacc or flex/bison:\n                        * While I have no explicitly benchmarked, I would expect parsers produced by lex/yacc or flex/bison to be faster than CoreParse ones.\n                        * CoreParse does not _require_ you to compile your parser before you start (though it is recommended).\n                        * CoreParse provides allows you to specify grammars right in your Objective-C source, rather than needing another language, which intermixes C/Obj-C.\n                        * CoreParse does not use global state, multiple parser instances can be run in parallel (or the same parser instance can parse multiple token streams in parallel).\n","homepage":"https://github.com/beelsebob/CoreParse","authors":"Tom Davie","license":"MIT","source":{"git":"https://github.com/beelsebob/CoreParse.git","tag":"1.1"},"source_files":["CoreParse","CoreParse/**/*.{h,m}"],"exclude_files":"CoreParse/CPSenTestKitAssertions.h","requires_arc":false,"migrated":true}
