It depends on the following Apple frameworks, which should already be included with most Xcode templates:\n\n                  * Foundation.framework\n                  * UIKit.framework\n                  * CoreGraphics.framework\n                  * QuartzCore.framework\n\n                  You will need LLVM 3.0 or later in order to build PNChart.\n\n\n\n\n                  ## Usage\n\n                  ### Cocoapods\n\n                  [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add PNChart to your project.\n\n                  1. Add a pod entry for PNChart to your Podfile `pod 'PNChart', '~> 0.5'`\n                  2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.\n                  3. Include PNChart wherever you need it with `#import \"PNChart.h\"`.\n\n\n                  ### Copy the PNChart folder to your project\n\n\n                  [![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/line.png)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/line.png)\n\n                  ```objective-c\n                    #import \"PNChart.h\"\n\n                    //For LineChart\n                    PNLineChart * lineChart = [[PNLineChart alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 135.0, SCREEN_WIDTH, 200.0)];\n                    [lineChart setXLabels:@[@\"SEP 1\",@\"SEP 2\",@\"SEP 3\",@\"SEP 4\",@\"SEP 5\"]];\n\n                    // Line Chart No.1\n                    NSArray * data01Array = @[@60.1, @160.1, @126.4, @262.2, @186.2];\n                    PNLineChartData *data01 = [PNLineChartData new];\n                    data01.color = PNFreshGreen;\n                    data01.itemCount = lineChart.xLabels.count;\n                    data01.getData = ^(NSUInteger index) {\n                        CGFloat yValue = [data01Array[index] floatValue];\n                        return [PNLineChartDataItem dataItemWithY:yValue];\n                    };\n                    // Line Chart No.2\n                    NSArray * data02Array = @[@20.1, @180.1, @26.4, @202.2, @126.2];\n                    PNLineChartData *data02 = [PNLineChartData new];\n                    data02.color = PNTwitterColor;\n                    data02.itemCount = lineChart.xLabels.count;\n                    data02.getData = ^(NSUInteger index) {\n                        CGFloat yValue = [data02Array[index] floatValue];\n                        return [PNLineChartDataItem dataItemWithY:yValue];\n                    };\n\n                    lineChart.chartData = @[data01, data02];\n                    [lineChart strokeChart];\n\n                  ```\n\n                  [![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/bar.png)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/bar.png)\n\n                  ```objective-c\n                    #import \"PNChart.h\"\n\n                    //For BarChart\n                    PNBarChart * barChart = [[PNBarChart alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 135.0, SCREEN_WIDTH, 200.0)];\n                    [barChart setXLabels:@[@\"SEP 1\",@\"SEP 2\",@\"SEP 3\",@\"SEP 4\",@\"SEP 5\"]];\n                    [barChart setYValues:@[@1,  @10, @2, @6, @3]];\n                    [barChart strokeChart];\n\n                  ```\n\n                  [![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/circle.png)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/circle.png)\n\n\n                  ```objective-c\n                  #import \"PNChart.h\"\n\n                  //For CircleChart\n\n                  PNCircleChart * circleChart = [[PNCircleChart alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 80.0, SCREEN_WIDTH, 100.0) andTotal:[NSNumber numberWithInt:100] andCurrent:[NSNumber numberWithInt:60] andClockwise:NO];\n                  circleChart.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];\n                  [circleChart setStrokeColor:PNGreen];\n                  [circleChart strokeChart];\n\n                  ```\n\n\n                  [![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/pie.png)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1599662/pie.png)\n\n                  ```objective-c\n                  #
