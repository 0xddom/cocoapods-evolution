See more about PVR images and video below.\n                      The GLModel and GLModelView classes allow you to load a 3D model using the popular WaveFront .obj format and display it in a view, again without needing to know anything about OpenGL.\n                      The GLView library is modular. If you don't want to render 3D models you can omit the Models classes and the rest of the library will still work. If you aren't interested in loading and displaying images and just want a basic OpenGL context set up for you, you can omit the Images and Models classes.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView","authors":{"Nick Lockwood":"support@charcoaldesign.co.uk"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView.git","tag":"1.5"},"platforms":{"ios":"4.3"},"source_files":["GLView/Core/","GLView/Images/","GLView/Models/"],"frameworks":["QuartzCore","OpenGLES"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}

With LicensesKit, your troubles are over!\n\n### LicensesKit is Flexible.\nA lot of the popular license-diaplaying libraries (namely [VTAcknowledgementsViewController](https://github.com/vtourraine/VTAcknowledgementsViewController) and [TRZSlideLicenseViewController](https://github.com/86/TRZSlideLicenseViewController)) only have support for if all of your libraries are in CocoaPods. While the automation of aggregating all the licenses is nice, it doesn't help if, say, you use [Google's API client](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/), which if don't want an [outdated pod](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Specs/Google-API-Client/0.1.1/Google-API-Client.podspec.json), you would just use the SVN from the project site. Also, some third-party libraries may be written in Swift (like this one), which is not supported by CocoaPods yet.\n\nWith LicensesKit you can just aggregate your libraries in a JSON file you include in your app bundle (learn more about specifics below), or add them in code if you prefer. This abstracts and simplifies things for you as the developer because you do not need to worry about where the library is coming from, all you need is to just list it.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mattwyskiel/LicensesKit","license":{"type":"Apache License, Version 2.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Matthew Wyskiel":"mwyskiel@optonline.net"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/MattWyskiel","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mattwyskiel/LicensesKit.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"source_files":["LicensesKit/LicensesViewController.swift","LicensesKit/NoticesHtmlBuilder.swift","LicensesKit/Model","LicensesKit/Model/Licenses"],"resources":["LicensesKit/Supporting Files/Licenses/*.txt","LicensesKit/LicensesViewController.xib"],"frameworks":"UIKit","dependencies":{"StringBuilder":["0.1.0"]},"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}

With LicensesKit, your troubles are over!\n\n### LicensesKit is Flexible.\nA lot of the popular license-diaplaying libraries (namely [VTAcknowledgementsViewController](https://github.com/vtourraine/VTAcknowledgementsViewController) and [TRZSlideLicenseViewController](https://github.com/86/TRZSlideLicenseViewController)) only have support for if all of your libraries are in CocoaPods. While the automation of aggregating all the licenses is nice, it doesn't help if, say, you use [Google's API client](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/), which if don't want an [outdated pod](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Specs/Google-API-Client/0.1.1/Google-API-Client.podspec.json), you would just use the SVN from the project site. Also, some third-party libraries may be written in Swift (like this one), which is not supported by CocoaPods yet.\n\nWith LicensesKit you can just aggregate your libraries in a JSON file you include in your app bundle (learn more about specifics below), or add them in code if you prefer.
