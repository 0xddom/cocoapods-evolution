You can also put a breakpoint on AERealtimeWatchdogUnsafeActivityWarning.\n\nIt won’t catch everything, and it won’t catch anything in Apple’s own system code, but it’ll catch some locks, some memory allocation, all Objective-C use (but not Swift), all object retains, and some common IO tasks, in your code and that of any static libraries you’re using.","homepage":"https://github.com/TheAmazingAudioEngine/RealtimeWatchdog","license":"zlib","authors":{"Michael Tyson":"michael@atastypixel.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/TheAmazingAudioEngine/RealtimeWatchdog.git","tag":"1.0.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"RealtimeWatchdog/*","pod_target_xcconfig":{"OTHER_CFLAGS":"-fno-modules"},"requires_arc":false,"migrated":true}
