For source apps, it leverages Facebook's App Links meta tags on the site to determine how to route the user. It attempts to open the app, but safely falls back to mobile web or the App Store depending on configuration. For receiving apps, the SDK makes it incredibly easy to map your App Links URI to a particular View Controller.","homepage":"https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Roots-iOS-SDK","license":"MIT","authors":{"Branch":"support@branch.io"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Roots-iOS-SDK.git","tag":"0.1.1"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/branchmetrics","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"Roots-iOS-SDK/**/*","migrated":true}
