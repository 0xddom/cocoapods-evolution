When the owning object\n                   is *about to* deallocate, `-invalidate` is sent to the\n                   observer object.\n\n                   This library includes pre-built observers for NSNotifcation,\n                   key-value observing, Core Data managed objects (observing\n                   `NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification` and\n                   testing if an observed managed object's attributes or\n                   relationships have changed), and FSEvents (on Mac desktop\n                   only).\n\n                   The purpose of this is to model observer registration as an\n                   object, each with an associated block. This removes the need\n                   for the owning objects to dispatch to the desired code (if\n                   the observation always funnels through a single callback,\n                   such as key-value observing), and removes the need to\n                   manually unregister for notifications. With that, the\n                   possibility of *forgetting* to unregister for a notification\n                   (and the subsequent crash or bad behavior) is removed.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/jmah/DMAutoInvalidation","license":{"type":"Apache","file":"LICENSE.txt"},"authors":{"Jonathon Mah":"me@JonathonMah.com","Wil Shipley":"wjs@mac.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/jmah/DMAutoInvalidation.git","tag":"2.1.2"},"source_files":"**/*.{h,m}","exclude_files":["DMBlockUtilities/DMBlockUtilitiesTest","DMKeyValueObserver/DMKeyValueObserverTest"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}

When the owning object\n                   is *about to* deallocate, `-invalidate` is sent to the\n                   observer object.\n\n                   This library includes pre-built observers for NSNotifcation,\n                   key-value observing, Core Data managed objects (observing\n                   `NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification` and\n                   testing if an observed managed object's attributes or\n                   relationships have changed), and FSEvents (on Mac desktop\n                   only).\n\n                   The purpose of this is to model observer registration as an\n                   object, each with an associated block.

To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'PARTagPicker'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the PRTagPicker directory first.\n\nInclude `#import <PARTagPicker/PARTagPickerViewController.h>`.\n\nThe basic setup is to create an instance of `PARTagPickerViewController`, add it's view, and then add the controller as a child view controller.\n\nThe tags are passed in as `NSString` objects in an array. Anytime you change the `allTags` array, any existing `chosenTags` are updated to use references to the new strings if they contain a match in the updated array. Otherwise they continue to point to the old strings.\n\n## Options\n* You can customize colors using a PARTagColorReference object.\n* You can allow new tags with `allowsNewTags` boolean property on the controller.\n* You can set the `chosenTags` directly.\n* Delegate methods for when the chosenTags change and the tag picker changes size.\n* `- (void)tagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker visibilityChangedToState:(PARTagPickerVisibilityState)state `\n* `- (void)chosenTagsWereUpdatedInTagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker`\n\n## Notes\n\nThis is still a work in progress. If you have suggestions or run into issues, please create an issue on git or tweet me [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe).\n\n## Updates\n* v1.4.0 - Swift example, expose cleaner PARTagColorReference init.\n* v1.0.3 - Making safe from some unexpected nil values.\n* v1.0.2 - Including `.xib`s in the pod now. Oops!\n* v1.0.0 - Added documentation and fixed bug with deselecting chosenTags. Added ability to use custom fonts in the tag cells.\n* v0.0.5 - Added expected functionality of chosenTags being removed when pressed.\n\n## Author\n\nPaul Rolfe, paul.a.rolfe@gmail.com, [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe)\n\n## License\n\nPARTagPicker is available under the MIT license.

This tag picker was originally used in the [Intrepid Pursuits](http://intrepid.io) app, Slate.\n\n## DEMO\n\nAs used in Slate:\n\n![DEMO IN SLATE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record1.gif)\n![DEMO IN SLATE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record4.gif)\n\nFrom example project:\n\n![DEMO IN EXAMPLE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record2.gif)\n![DEMO IN EXAMPLE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record3.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\nPARTagPicker is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'PARTagPicker'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the PRTagPicker directory first.\n\nInclude `#import <PARTagPicker/PARTagPickerViewController.h>`.\n\nThe basic setup is to create an instance of `PARTagPickerViewController`, add it's view, and then add the controller as a child view controller.\n\nThe tags are passed in as `NSString` objects in an array. Anytime you change the `allTags` array, any existing `chosenTags` are updated to use references to the new strings if they contain a match in the updated array. Otherwise they continue to point to the old strings.\n\n## Options\n* You can customize colors using a PARTagColorReference object.\n* You can allow new tags with `allowsNewTags` boolean property on the controller.\n* You can set the `chosenTags` directly.\n* Delegate methods for when the chosenTags change and the tag picker changes size.\n* `- (void)tagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker visibilityChangedToState:(PARTagPickerVisibilityState)state `\n* `- (void)chosenTagsWereUpdatedInTagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker`\n\n## Notes\n\nThis is still a work in progress. If you have suggestions or run into issues, please create an issue on git or tweet me [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe).\n\n## Updates\n* v1.0.3 - Making safe from some unexpected nil values.\n* v1.0.2 - Including `.xib`s in the pod now. Oops!\n* v1.0.0 - Added documentation and fixed bug with deselecting chosenTags. Added ability to use custom fonts in the tag cells.\n* v0.0.5 - Added expected functionality of chosenTags being removed when pressed.\n\n## Author\n\nPaul Rolfe, paul.a.rolfe@gmail.com, [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe)\n\n## License\n\nPARTagPicker is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.","migrated":true}
