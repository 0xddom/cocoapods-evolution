An observer can even be cancelled from two thread simultaneously.\n* Automatic unregistering when the observed object deallocates.\n* Support for providing an observing object that is given to the block, and automatic unregistering when this observing object deallocates. This lets you call methods on `self` without retaining it or dealing with a weak reference.\n* Thread-safety for the automatic deallocation. This protects against receiving messages on another thread while the object is deallocating.\n* First-class support for both Obj-C and Swift, including strong typing in the Swift API.","homepage":"https://github.com/postmates/PMKVObserver","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE-MIT"},"authors":{"Lily Ballard":"lily@sb.org"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/postmates/PMKVObserver.git","tag":"v4.1.2"},"requires_arc":true,"platforms":{"ios":"8.0","osx":"10.9","watchos":"2.0","tvos":"9.0"},"swift_version":"4.0","subspecs":[{"name":"ObjC","source_files":"PMKVObserver/**/*.{h,m}"},{"name":"Swift","source_files":"PMKVObserver/**/*.{swift}","dependencies":{"PMKVObserver/ObjC":[]}}],"migrated":true}
