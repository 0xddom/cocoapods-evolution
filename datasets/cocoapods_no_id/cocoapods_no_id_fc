(The leaves (final nodes) of the tree contain no key and have no structure to distinguish them from one another. Leaves are commonly represented by a special leaf or nil symbol, a NULL pointer, etc.)\nThis is implementation of algorithm from `Algorithhms 4th Edition` by Robert Sedgewick.","homepage":"https://github.com/NickKibish/BinarySearchTree","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Mykola Kibysh":"mykola.kibysh@ticketmaster.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/NickKibish/BinarySearchTree.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"NKBinarySearchTree/**/*","dependencies":{"NKQueue":[]},"pushed_with_swift_version":"3.0","migrated":true}
