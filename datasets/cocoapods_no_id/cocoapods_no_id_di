{"name":"MHRadialProgressView","version":"0.0.1","summary":"iOS 7 drop-in-class radial progress view.","description":"\t\t\t\tMHRadialProgressView is an iOS drop-in class radial progress view.\n\n\t\t\t\t[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView/master/ScreenShots/placeit.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView/master/ScreenShots/placeit.png)\n\t\t\t\t_(by placeit)_\n\n\t\t\t\t##Requirements\n\t\t\t\tMHRadialProgressView works on iOS 5 and above and is compatible with ARC projects. It depends on the following Apple frameworks:\n\n\t\t\t\t* Foundation.framework\n\t\t\t\t* UIKit.framework\n\n\t\t\t\t##Including MHRadialProgressView to your project\n\n\t\t\t\t### Source files\n\n\t\t\t\tYou can directly add the `MHRadialProgressView.h` and `MHRadialProgressView.m` source files to your project.\n\n\t\t\t\t1. Download the latest zip from github or clone the source in your desired directory.\n\t\t\t\t2. Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop `MHRadialProgressView.h` and `MHRadialProgressView.m` onto your project (use the \"Product Navigator view\"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project. \n\t\t\t\t3. Include MHRadialProgressView with `#import \"MHRadialProgressView.h\"`.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t### Cocoapods\n\t\t\t\t[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add MHTextField to your project.\n\n\t\t\t\t1. Add a pod entry for MHRadialProgressView to your Podfile `pod 'MHTextField', '~> 0.0.1'`\n\t\t\t\t2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.\n\t\t\t\t3. Include MHTextField with `#import \"MHRadialProgressView.h\"`\n\n\n\t\t\t\t## Usage \n\t\t\t\t1. Initialize the view with steps that define a particular operation complete.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tself.progressView = [[MHRadialProgressView alloc] \tinitWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 150, 150) points:@[@5, @10, @2, @9]];\n\n\t\t\t\t2. Add it as subview:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[self.view addSubview:self.progressView];\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3. Make progress by calling the following method:\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[self.progressView moveNext];\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBy default, the progress view displays % value. However you can override the style by calling the following method:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Default is MHProgressStylePercentage. Sets the progress style\n\t\t\t\t\t- (void)setProgressStyle:(MHProgressStyle)style;\n\n\t\t\t\tIt is also possible to format the label that displays the progress value using the folloiwng method:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- (void)setLabelWithFormat:(NSString*)format;\n\n\t\t\t\tFor unordered progres (often by steps associated wtih user action), you can increase the progress by value:\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- (void) moveNext:(NSNumber*)value;\n\n\t\t\t\t## License\n\n\t\t\t\tThis code is distributed under the terms and conditions of the [MIT license](LICENSE). \n","homepage":"https://github.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView","screenshots":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView/master/ScreenShots/placeit.png","license":"MIT","authors":{"Mehfuz Hossain":"mehfuz@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":"MHRadialProgressView/Classes/MHRadialProgressView.{h,m}","requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
