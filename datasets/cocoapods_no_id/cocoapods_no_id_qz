{"name":"RITypedNotification","version":"1.0.0","summary":"RITypedNotification Library","description":"# TypedNotification\n\nThe `TypedNotification` microframework allows you to use `NotificationCenter` to post and receive strongly-typed notifications with associated data, without having to manually pack and unpack a `userInfo` dictionary.\n\nUsing a typed notification is simple. First, define a notification type:\n\n```\nstruct MyNotification: TypedNotification {\n    var value: String\n}\n```\n\nNext, use `NotificationCenter` to add an observer for that notification:\n\n```\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n    private var token: NotificationToken?\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n\n        token = NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(for: MyNotification.self) { [weak self] (notification) in\n            self?.received(notification)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func received(_ notification: MyNotification) {\n        print(notification.value)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example, `MyViewController` retains the `NotificationToken` returned by `NotificationCenter.addObserver()`. When the `MyViewController` instance is deallocated, the `NotificationToken` is deallocated and the observer is deregistered. **The `[weak self]` capture list is important. Without it, there _will_ be a retain cycle causing a memory leak.**\n\nFinally, use `NotificationCenter` to post notifications:\n\n```\nNotificationCenter.default.post(MyNotification(value: \"foobar\"), from: self)\n```","homepage":"https://www.rocketinsights.com","authors":"Paul Calnan","source":{"git":"https://github.com/rocketinsights/RITypedNotification.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"license":{"type":"MIT"},"platforms":{"ios":"11.0"},"swift_versions":"5.0","source_files":"Sources/TypedNotification/**/*.swift","swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}

From not being\nable to move as fast as you want, to bloating and destabilizing your app, to losing control and ownership of your 1st party data.\n\nmParticle solves all these problems with one lightweight SDK.

You also need several tools and services to make data-driven decisions.\nLike most app owners, you end up implementing and maintaining numerous SDKs ranging from analytics, attribution, push notification, remarketing,\nmonetization, etc. But embedding multiple 3rd party libraries creates a number of unintended consequences and hidden costs. From not being\nable to move as fast as you want, to bloating and destabilizing your app, to losing control and ownership of your 1st party data.\n\nmParticle solves all these problems with one lightweight SDK. Implement new partners without changing code or waiting for app store approval.\nImprove stability and security within your app. We enable our clients to spend more time innovating and less time integrating.","homepage":"http://www.mparticle.com","license":{"type":"Apache 2.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"mParticle":"support@mparticle.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mParticle/mParticle-iOS-SDK.git","tag":"5.2.0"},"documentation_url":"http://docs.mparticle.com","social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/mparticles","requires_arc":true,"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"default_subspecs":["mParticle","CrashReporter","Adjust","Appboy","BranchMetrics","comScore","Flurry","Kahuna","Kochava","Localytics"],"deprecated":true,"subspecs":[{"name":"Core-SDK","public_header_files":["Pod/Classes/mParticle.h","Pod/Classes/MPEnums.h","Pod/Classes/MPUserSegments.h","Pod/Classes/Event/MPEvent.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPCommerce.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPCommerceEvent.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPCart.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPProduct.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPPromotion.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPTransactionAttributes.h","Pod/Classes/Ecommerce/MPBags.h"],"source_files":"Pod/Classes/**/*","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"frameworks":["Accounts","CoreGraphics","CoreLocation","CoreTelephony","Foundation","Security","Social","SystemConfiguration","UIKit","Wootric"],"weak_frameworks":["AdSupport","iAd"],"libraries":["c++","sqlite3","z"]},{"name":"Adjust","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Adjust":["~> 4.3"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_ADJUST 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Appboy","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Appboy-iOS-SDK":["~> 2.17"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_APPBOY 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"BranchMetrics","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Branch":["~> 0.11"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_BRANCHMETRICS 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"comScore","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"comScore-iOS-SDK":["~> 3.1502.26"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_COMSCORE 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"frameworks":["AVFoundation","CoreMedia","MediaPlayer"]},{"name":"Crittercism","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"CrittercismSDK":["5.4.0"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_CRITTERCISM 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Flurry","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Flurry-iOS-SDK/FlurrySDK":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_FLURRY 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Kahuna","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"KahunaSDK":["1.0.571"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_KAHUNA 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Kochava","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Kochava":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_KOCHAVA 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Localytics","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"Localytics":["~> 3.5"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_LOCALYTICS 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"Wootric","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"WootricSDK":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_WOOTRIC 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"mParticle","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_KIT_MPARTICLE 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}},{"name":"CrashReporter","dependencies":{"mParticle-iOS-SDK/Core-SDK":[],"mParticle-iOS-SDK/mParticle":[],"mParticle-CrashReporter":["~> 1.2"]},"prefix_header_contents":"#define MP_CRASH_REPORTER 1","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"}}],"migrated":true}
