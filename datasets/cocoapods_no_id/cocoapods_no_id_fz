Has-a vs. is-a or pretends-to-be-a. It allows configuration of the text container's height.

Has-a vs. is-a or pretends-to-be-a. It allows configuration of the text container's height. And it takes into account measurements of the text view's                        inset.\n                        \n                           Original source here:\n                           https://github.com/jaredsinclair/JTSTextView\n                        \n                           Hopefully, iOS 9 will continue the long chain of text improvements on iOS and we won't need these shenanigans anymore.

For example if you need to read characteristic value, you need to call \"connect\" on central object, wait for Central delegate callback, After that call \"discover services\", wait peripheral delegate callback, \"discover characteristic\" which you planned and wait for delegate callback, \"readValue\" and again wait for delegate callback. What will happen if your program will make 2 connections at once? Handling such cases makes messy code, and raises hundred of bugs.\n\nDon't worry, now you can forgot about that hell - LGBluetooth uses blocks for callbacks, you can start using modern code and hierarchical calls.\n","homepage":"socialobjects-software.github.io/LGBluetooth","license":"MIT","authors":{"David Sahakyan":"loggerdev@gmail.com"},"source_files":"LGBluetooth/*","ios":{"frameworks":"CoreBluetooth"},"osx":{"frameworks":["IOBluetooth","IOBluetoothUI"]},"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
