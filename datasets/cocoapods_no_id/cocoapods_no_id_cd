You should probably use the Nabto Client pod instead as it provides a higher level Objective C wrapper. Any suggestions on how to cleanly combine source files (the Objective C wrapper) with an external dependency (not in github - the large Nabto library files are deployed on CDN) are appreciated :-).\n\nThe Nabto communication platform enables you to establish direct connections from a client to even the most resource constrained devices, regardless of the firewall configuration of each peer - a P2P middleware that supports IoT well. \n\nThe platform has been designed from the ground and up with strong security as a focal point. All in all, it enables vendors to create simple, high performant and secure solutions for their Internet connected products with very little effort.","homepage":"https://www.nabto.com","license":{"type":"Commercial","file":"nabto-libs-ios-static/LICENSE.txt"},"authors":{"Nabto":"apps@nabto.com"},"source":{"http":"https://downloads.nabto.com/assets/nabto-ios-client-static/4.3.0-beta.3/nabto-libs-ios-static.zip"},"source_files":["nabto-libs-ios-static/ios/lib","nabto-libs-ios-static/ios/include/*.h"],"public_header_files":"**/*.h","ios":{"libraries":["c++","stdc++"]},"vendored_libraries":["nabto-libs-ios-static/ios/lib/libnabto_client_api_static.a","nabto-libs-ios-static/ios/lib/libnabto_static_external.a"],"migrated":true}
