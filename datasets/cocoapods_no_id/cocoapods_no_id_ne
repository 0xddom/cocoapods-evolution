The focus is on having components that are not application-specific, so that they can be easily integrated into multiple applications.\nThe main feature of the library is the secure storage. The library itself is data type – agnostic and can handle both sensitive and plain user data. Based on the data definition, the library has internal mechanisms to retrieve/store content or manipulate data pieces.\nOther features include QR-based login, barcode reader, OCR reader/parser, OTP generator, fingerprint/pin/pattern/faceId authorization.","homepage":"https://github.com/telekom/SmartCredentials-SDK-ios.git","license":{"type":"Apache License, Version 2.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":"Deutsche Telekom AG","platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"swift_versions":"5.0","source":{"git":"https://github.com/telekom/SmartCredentials-SDK-ios.git","tag":"5.3.4"},"exclude_files":"SmartCredentials/Authentication/AppAuth/","subspecs":[{"name":"Core","source_files":"SmartCredentials/Core/Core/**/*.{h,swift}"},{"name":"Authentication","source_files":"SmartCredentials/Authentication/Authentication/**/*.{h,swift}","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[],"AppAuth":[]}},{"name":"Authorization","source_files":"SmartCredentials/Authorization/**/*.{h,swift}","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[]}},{"name":"CameraScanner","source_files":"SmartCredentials/CameraScanner/**/*.{h,swift,framework}","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[],"TesseractOCRiOS":[]}},{"name":"Encryption","source_files":"SmartCredentials/Encryption/**/*.{h,swift}","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[]}},{"name":"Networking","source_files":"SmartCredentials/Networking/**/*.{h,m,swift}","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[]}},{"name":"OTP","source_files":"SmartCredentials/OTP/**/*.swift","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[],"SmartCredentialsLibrary/CameraScanner":[],"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Storage":[]}},{"name":"QRLogin","source_files":"SmartCredentials/QRLogin/**/*.{h,swift,framework}","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[],"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Authorization":[],"Starscream":[]}},{"name":"Storage","source_files":"SmartCredentials/Storage/Storage/**/*.{h,swift,xcdatamodeld}","dependencies":{"SmartCredentialsLibrary/Core":[]},"resource_bundles":{"CredentialsModel":["SmartCredentials/**/*.xcdatamodeld"]},"resources":"SmartCredentials/**/*.xcdatamodeld"}],"swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}

To make this mission a reality, we have created the Affdex SDK so that others can bring emotion sensing and analytics to their own offerings, be it digital experiences, apps, games, devices, or other technologies.\n\nUsing our SDK, developers can now enrich digital experiences and apps by detecting emotion. Devices can now instantly respond to a user’s unfiltered emotions, and apps can adjust their interfaces and flow to better suit moods. This makes for a more authentic, interactive, and unique experience.","homepage":"http://developer.affectiva.com","license":{"type":"Commercial","file":"LICENSE.md"},"authors":"Affectiva","social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/affectiva","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"http":"https://download.affectiva.com/apple/affdex-sdk_ios_3_2_0_621.tar.gz"},"ios":{"vendored_frameworks":"ios/Affdex.framework","libraries":"c++","frameworks":["UIKit","CoreMedia","AudioToolbox","AVFoundation","CoreVideo","QuartzCore","CoreImage","CoreGraphics","Foundation","SystemConfiguration","AssetsLibrary"],"dependencies":{"AWSKinesis":[]}},"migrated":true}
