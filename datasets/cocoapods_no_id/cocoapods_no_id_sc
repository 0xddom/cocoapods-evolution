This means that the vertical scrollers appear on the left side instead of the right.\n\nThis is useful for content that is oriented from right-to-left, such as an `NSTextView` with Arabic text.\n\nOn macOS 10.12, horizontally inverted scrollers were natively implemented, but require that `[NSApp userInterfaceLayoutDirection]` be set to `NSUserInterfaceLayoutDirectionRightToLeft`, which is not programmatically controllable. \n\nIn other words, the app's `userInterfaceLayoutDirection` affects all `NSScrollView`s in the app, hardly desirable for most use cases.\n\nAdditionally, the native implementation does not correctly mirror vertical scrollers.\n\nThe code subclasses `NSScrollView` and `NSScroller`.\nThere's also optional, but recommended, private method swizzling on `NSOverlayScrollerImp`.\n\n`contentInsets` introduced in macOS 10.10 are also supported.\n\nThis code was originally created for https://katibapp.com/","homepage":"https://github.com/aiaf/MKKRightToLeftScrollView","screenshots":"https://i.imgur.com/silOzZU.png","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Abdullah Arif":"abdullah.a@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/aiaf/MKKRightToLeftScrollView.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/abdullaharif","source_files":"MKKRightToLeftScrollView/**/*","platforms":{"osx":"10.8"},"migrated":true}
