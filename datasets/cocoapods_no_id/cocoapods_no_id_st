Influenced by ClusterPrePermissions, with the goal of being lighter weight, and generally allowing clients to be more hands off.\n\n                      It takes care of all permissions and UI, and is automatically retained in memory for as long as the user is actively choosing. There is no need for clients to maintain a reference.\n\n                      It takes care of presenting the right photo picker or camera components. It takes care of asking for permissions, informing the user why permissions are lacking, when they're lacking, and sends them to Settings.app to take care of any problems they might need to.\n\n                      In short, CGLMediaPicker lets you, the client, say: I would like the user to give me a piece of media.

EarlGrey automatically synchronizes with the UI, network requests, and various queues, but still allows you to manually implement customized timings, if needed.\\n\\nEarlGrey’s synchronization features help ensure that the UI is in a steady state before actions are performed. This greatly increases test stability and makes tests highly repeatable.\\n\\nEarlGrey works in conjunction with the XCTest framework and integrates with Xcode’s Test Navigator so you can run tests

{"name":"EarlGreyTest","version":"2.2.0","summary":"EarlGrey is a native iOS UI automation test framework that enables you to write clear, concise tests.\\n\\nWith the EarlGrey framework, you have access to enhanced synchronization features. EarlGrey automatically synchronizes with the UI, network requests, and various queues, but still allows you to manually implement customized timings, if needed.\\n\\nEarlGrey’s synchronization features help ensure that the UI is in a steady state before actions are performed. This greatly increases test stability and makes tests highly repeatable.\\n\\nEarlGrey works in conjunction with the XCTest framework and integrates with Xcode’s Test Navigator so you can run tests directly from Xcode or the command line (using xcodebuild).","homepage":"https://github.com/google/EarlGrey","authors":"Google LLC.","license":{"type":"Apache
