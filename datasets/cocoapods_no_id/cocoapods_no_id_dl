{"name":"InterfaceKit","version":"5.4.0","summary":"InterfaceKit helps you use interface of UIKit, AppKit and WatchKit in SwiftUI interface easily","description":"This is supported by [Saidong Zhang](https://zsd.name)\n\nits intention is to help people use interface of UIKit, AppKit and WatchKit in SwiftUI interface easily.\n/// You create custom views by declaring types that conform to the ``View``\n/// protocol. Implement the required ``View/body-swift.property`` computed\n/// property to provide the content for your custom view. Then you can present your UIKit\n/// ViewController View by using `InterfaceView(MyView())` , as follows.\n```\n///\n///     struct MyView: View {\n///         var body: some View {\n///             InterfaceView(MyView())\n///         }\n///     }\n///\n```\n/// The ``View`` protocol provides a large set of modifiers, defined as protocol\n/// methods with default implementations, that you use to position and configure\n/// views in the layout of your app. Modifiers typically work by wrapping the\n/// view instance on which you call them in another view with the specified\n/// characteristics. For example, adding the ``View/opacity(_:)`` modifier to a\n/// interface view returns a new view with some amount of transparency:\n```\n///\n///     InterfaceView(MyView())\n///         .opacity(0.5) // Display partially transparent interface view.\n///\n```\n/// It is recommended to use `ZStack` with `InterfaceView` , as follows.\n```\n///\n///     ZStack {\n///         InterfaceView(MyView())\n///         MySwiftUIView()\n///     }\n///\n```","homepage":"https://github.com/adong666666/InterfaceKit","license":"MIT","authors":{"Saidong Zhang":"3440217568@qq.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/adong666666/InterfaceKit.git","tag":"5.4.0"},"requires_arc":true,"platforms":{"ios":"13.0","osx":"10.15","watchos":"6.0","tvos":"13.0"},"source_files":"Sources/InterfaceKit/*.swift","exclude_files":"","frameworks":"SwiftUI","swift_versions":"5.4","subspecs":[{"name":"UIKit","source_files":"Sources/InterfaceKit/UIInterface.swift"},{"name":"AppKit","source_files":"Sources/InterfaceKit/NSInterface.swift"},{"name":"WatchKit","source_files":"Sources/InterfaceKit/WKInterface.swift"}],"swift_version":"5.4","migrated":true}
