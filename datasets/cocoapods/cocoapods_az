String ?? \"\"\nreturn CellView(title: title)\n}),\n]\n```\n\n`MIDITimeTableViewDataSource` is very likely to `UITableViewDataSource` or `UICollectionViewDataSource` API. Just feed the row data, number of rows, time signature and you are ready to go.\n\n``` swift\nfunc numberOfRows(in midiTimeTableView: MIDITimeTableView) -> Int {\nreturn rowData.count\n}\n\nfunc timeSignature(of midiTimeTableView: MIDITimeTableView) -> MIDITimeTableTimeSignature {\nreturn MIDITimeTableTimeSignature(beats: 4, noteValue: .quarter)\n}\n\nfunc midiTimeTableView(_ midiTimeTableView: MIDITimeTableView, rowAt index: Int) -> MIDITimeTableRowData {\nlet row = rowData[index]\nreturn row\n}\n```\n\nYou can customise the measure bar, the grid, each header and data cell. Check out the example project.\n\n`MIDITimeTableCellView`'s are editable, you can move around them on the grid, resize their duration or long press to open a delete menu. Also, you need to subclass yourself to present your own data on it.\n\nYou can set the `minMeasureWidth` and `maxMeasureWidth` to set zoom levels of the time table.","homepage":"https://github.com/cemolcay/MIDITimeTableView","license":"MIT","authors":{"cemolcay":"ccemolcay@gmail.com"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/cemolcay","platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cemolcay/MIDITimeTableView.git","tag":"1.0.1"},"source_files":"MIDITimeTableView/Source/*.swift","requires_arc":true,"pushed_with_swift_version":"3.0","migrated":true}
