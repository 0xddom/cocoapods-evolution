Most importants are `Pitch`, `Key`, `Scale` and `Chord`.\n\nAll data types conforms `Codable`, `CustomStringConvertable`.\n`Pitch`, and `Accident` structs are `RawPresentable` with `Int` as well as `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` that you can represent them directly with `Int`s.\n\n#### `Pitch` and `Key`\n\n- All keys can be defined with `Key` struct.\n- It has a `KeyType` where you can set the base key like C, D, A, G, and an `Accitental` where it can be `.natural`, `.flat`, `sharp` or more specific like `.sharps(amount: 3)`.\n- You can create `Pitch`es with a `Key` and octave.\n- Also, you can create `Pitch`es with MIDI note number. `rawValue` of a pitch is its MIDI note number.\n- `Pitch`, `Key`, `Accidental` structs are equatable, `+` and `-` custom operators defined for making calulations easier.\n- Also, there are other helper functions or properties like frequency of a note.\n\n``` swift\nlet dFlat = Key(type: d, accidental: .flat)\nlet c4 = Pitch(key: Key(type: .c), octave: 4)\n```\n\n#### `Interval`\n\n- Intervals are halfsteps between pitches.\n- They are `IntegerLiteral` and you can make add/subsctract them between themselves, notes or note types.\n- You can build up a custom interval with its quality, degree and semitone properties.\n- You can build scales or chords from intervals.\n- Minor, major, perfect, augmented and diminished intervals up to 2 octaves are predefined.\n\n#### `ScaleType` and `Scale`\n\n- `ScaleType` enum defines a lot of readymade scales.\n- Also, you can create a custom scale type by `ScaleType.custom(intervals: [Interval], description: String)`\n- `Scale` defines a scale with a scale type and root key.\n- You can generate notes of scale in an octave range.\n- Also you can generate `HarmonicField` of a scale.\n- Harmonic field is all possible triad, tetrad or extended chords in a scale.\n\n``` swift\nlet c = Key(type: .c)\nlet maj: ScaleType = .major\nlet cMaj = Scale(type: maj, key: c)\n```\n\n#### `ChordType` and `Chord`\n\n- `ChordType` is a struct with `ChordPart`s which are building blocks of chords.\n- You can define any chord existing with `ChordType`.\n- Thirds, fifths, sixths, sevenths and extensions are parts of the `ChordType`.\n- Each of them also structs which conforms `ChordPart` protocol.\n- `Chord` defines chords with type and a root key.\n- You can generate notes of chord in any octave range.\n- You can generate inversions of any chord.\n\n``` swift\nlet m13 = ChordType(\nthird: .minor,\nseventh: .dominant,\nextensions: [\nChordExtensionType(type: .thirteenth)\n])\nlet cm13 = Chord(type: m13, key: Key(type: .c))\n```\n\n- You can generate chord progressions with `ChordProgression` enum.\n- For any scale, in any harmonic field, for any inversion.\n\n``` swift\nlet progression = ChordProgression.i_ii_vi_iv\nlet cSharpHarmonicMinorTriadsProgression = progression.chords(\nfor: cSharpHarmonicMinor,\nharmonicField: .triad,\ninversion: 0)\n```\n\n#### `Tempo` and `TimeSignature`\n\n- Tempo is a helper struct to define timings in your music app.\n- TimeSignature is number of beats in per measure and `NoteValue` of each beat.\n- You can calculate notes duration in any tempo by ther `NoteValue`.\n- Note value defines the note's duration in a beat. It could be whole note, half note, quarter note, 8th, 16th or 32nd note.\n\nDocumentation\n----\n\n[Full documentation are here](https://cemolcay.github.io/MusicTheory/)\n\nUnit Tests\n----\n\nYou can find unit tests in `MusicTheoryTests` target.\nPress `⌘+U` for running tests.\n\nAppStore\n----\n\nThis library battle tested in my apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, check them out!\n[KeyBud](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keybud-music-theory-app/id1203856335?mt=8) (iOS, watchOS, tvOS, macOS)\n[FretBud](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fretbud-chord-scales-for-guitar-bass-and-more/id1234224249?mt=8) (iOS, watchOS, tvOS)\n[ChordBud](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chordbud-chord-progressions/id1313017378?mt=8) (iOS)\n[ArpBud](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arpbud-midi-sequencer-more/id1349342326?ls=1&mt=8) (iOS)\n[ScaleBud](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scalebud-auv3-midi-keyboard/id1409125865?ls=1&mt=8) (iOS, AUv3)","homepage":"https://github.com/cemolcay/MusicTheory","license":"MIT","authors":{"cemolcay":"ccemolcay@gmail.com"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/cemolcay","platforms":{"ios":"8.0","osx":"10.9","watchos":"2.0","tvos":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cemolcay/MusicTheory.git","tag":"1.1.0"},"source_files":"Source/*.{swift}","frameworks":"Foundation","requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}

Displays podcasts and audiobooks (unlike MPMediaPickerController in iOS 8.4+).\n    2. Can be used as a modal view controller or within a UINavigationController.\n    3. Colors can optionally be customized to match the rest of your app.\n    4. Images can optionally be provided as replacements for Back, Done and Cancel buttons.\n    5. Displays number of items chosen in title when choosing multiple items.\n    6. Supports landscape and portrait.\n    7. Supports subclassing for easier customization.\n\nSimilar features as MPMediaPickerController:\n\n    1. Displays top-level audio choices for easy browsing (Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists, etc.)\n    2. Can be configured to choose only one or multiple items at once.\n    3. Can filter out only audio types requested.\n    4. Can filter out cloud items.\n    5. Provides a + button to include all items below the current level.\n    6.
