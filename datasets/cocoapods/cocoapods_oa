When going over any view, like a button, he can use gestures to activate that action.\n    We have four types of gestures: Blink right eye; blinking left eye; show the language or with a voice command. This voice command can receive four actions, the first is to touch something, second to return\n    in navigation with navigationcontroller, the next and the previous, to use in views that have scroll, such as cell phone and collectionsviews. For other actions, you must integrate components that can facilitate the time of use\n    of the application.\n    The voice action is still in the testing phase. The most recommended is that of the tongue, as they had the best results, thus reducing repetitive effort.\nTo use it, just change the inheritance of a class that inherits from the viewcontroller by AccessibilityFaceAnchorViewController and start the necessary resources.\nFor a better use of the user, there is the AccessibilityGetSensitivityViewController class, which has the function of capturing the limitations of the user's face and thus adapting to his rhythm.","homepage":"https://github.com/JBatista1/AcessibilityFaceCursor","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"João Batista":"j.batista.damasceno@icloud.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/JBatista1/AcessibilityFaceCursor.git","tag":"0.0.7"},"platforms":{"ios":"13.0"},"source_files":"AcessibilityFaceCursor/**/*.{h,m,swift}","resource_bundles":{"AcessibilityFaceCursor":["AcessibilityFaceCursor/*.xcassets"]},"swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}

Write your `viewDidLoad` as follows:\n\n```swift\n\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    \n    self.dataSource = self\n    self.delegate \t= self\n    \n    self.reloadData()\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, implement the `HLTabPagerDataSource` to populate the view.\nThe data source has a couple of required methods, and a few more optional.\n\n### Data Source\nThe data source methods will allow you to provide content to your tab pager view controller.\n\n#### Required Methods\n```swift\nfunc numberOfViewControllers() -> Int\n\nfunc viewController(forIndex index: Int) -> UIViewController\n\n```\n\n#### Optional Methods\n**Note that despite being optional, the tab setup will require you to return either a `UIView` or an `String` to work.**\n\n```swift\n\noptional func viewForTab(atIndex index: Int) -> UIView\noptional func titleForTab(atIndex index: Int) -> String\noptional func tabHeight() -> CGFloat\noptional func tabColor() -> UIColor\noptional func tabBackgroundColor() -> UIColor\noptional func titleFont() -> UIFont\noptional func titleColor() -> UIColor\noptional func bottomLineHeight() -> CGFloat\n\n```\n\n### Delegate\nThe delegate methods report events that happened in the tab pager view controller.\n\n#### Optional Methods\n```swift\noptional func tabPager(_ tabPager: HLTabPagerViewController, willTransitionToTab atIndex: Int)\noptional func tabPager(_ tabPager: HLTabPagerViewController, didTransitionToTab atIndex: Int)\n```\n\n### Public\nThere are two public methods:\n\n```swift\nopen func reloadData()\nopen func selectTabbar(atIndex index: Int, animation: Bool = false)\n```\n\n`reloadData` will refresh the content of the tab pager view controller.
