Therefore, sensible\n  values are hardcoded in the Go wrapper.\n- The ports where the PTs will listen on are hardcoded, since communicating\n  the used ports back to the app would be quite some work (e.g. trying to\n  read it from STDOUT) for very little benefit.\n- Snowflake and Obfs4proxy are patched to accept all configuration parameters\n  directly.\n\nBoth PTs are contained at their latest `master` commit, as per 2021-03-07.","homepage":"https://github.com/tladesignz/IPtProxy","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Benjamin Erhart":"berhart@netzarchitekten.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tladesignz/IPtProxy.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/tladesignz","platforms":{"ios":"11.0"},"preserve_paths":["build.sh","*.patch","IPtProxy.go/*"],"prepare_command":"./build.sh","script_phases":{"name":"Go build of IPtProxy.framework","execution_position":"before_compile","script":"sh \"$PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT/build.sh\""},"vendored_frameworks":"IPtProxy.framework","migrated":true}

Both PTs are patched\n  to avoid this.\n- Both PTs are gathered under one roof here, since you cannot have two\n  `gomobile` frameworks in your iOS code, since there are some common Go\n  runtime functions exported, which will create a name clash.\n- Environment variable changes during runtime will not be recognized by\n  `goptlib` when done from within Swift/Objective-C. Therefore, sensible\n  values are hardcoded in the Go wrapper.\n- The ports where the PTs will listen on are hardcoded, since communicating\n  the used ports back to the app would be quite some work (e.g. trying to\n  read it from STDOUT) for very little benefit.\n- Snowflake currently can only be configured via command line, not via the\n  PT spec's method of using SOCKS username and password arguments.\n  Therefore Snowflake is patched to accept arguments via its `Main` method.\n\nBoth PTs are contained at their latest `master` commit, as per 2020-09-10.","homepage":"https://github.com/tladesignz/IPtProxy","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Benjamin Erhart":"berhart@netzarchitekten.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tladesignz/IPtProxy.git","tag":"0.4.0"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/tladesignz","platforms":{"ios":"11.0"},"preserve_paths":["build.sh","*.patch","IPtProxy.go/*"],"prepare_command":"./build.sh","script_phases":{"name":"Go build of IPtProxy.framework","execution_position":"before_compile","script":"sh \"$PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT/build.sh\""},"vendored_frameworks":"IPtProxy.framework","migrated":true}

All you need to do is to include the Tml header file in your app, initialize the SDK and use the various translation macros to internationalize your content.\n\nThe SDK comes with its own language selector, where users can switch languages. Or you can use the language set by the OS.\n\nIt also comes with In-App Translator - where you can ask your users to help translate your app right from within your app.\n\nTml SDK integrates with TranslationExchange.com service, where you can manage the entire translation process - add new languages, invite translators, manage phrases, and much more.\n\nOnce the translations are done, they will be automatically downloaded and installed by the SDK in your app. Everything is done real-time - you DO NOT need to submit a new application to the App Store. You can simply enable a new language on TranslationExchange and it will immediately be available in your application.\n\nYou can learn more about the SDK by visiting the project's GitHub page:\n    \n    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc\n\nor running sample applications:\n\nDemo app that comes with the SDK:\n\n    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc/tree/master/Project\n\n“Wammer” application that shows how the SDK can be integrated into a messaging app:\n\n    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc-samples-wammer\n\n","license":"MIT","authors":{"Michael Berkovich":"michael@translationexchnage.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc.git","tag":"0.2.1"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/translationx","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Classes","resources":"Assets","ios":{"exclude_files":"Classes/osx"},"osx":{"exclude_files":"Classes/ios"},"public_header_files":"Classes/**/*.h","dependencies":{"MPColorTools":["~> 1.6"],"MBProgressHUD":["~> 0.9"]},"migrated":true}

All you need to do is to include the Tml header file in your app, initialize the SDK and use the various translation macros to internationalize your content.\n\nThe SDK comes with its own language selector, where users can switch languages. Or you can use the language set by the OS.\n\nIt also comes with In-App Translator - where you can ask your users to help translate your app right from within your app.\n\nTml SDK integrates with TranslationExchange.com service, where you can manage the entire translation process - add new languages, invite translators, manage phrases, and much more.\n\nOnce the translations are done, they will be automatically downloaded and installed by the SDK in your app. Everything is done real-time - you DO NOT need to submit a new application to the App Store. You can simply enable a new language on TranslationExchange and it will immediately be available in your application.\n\nYou can learn more about the SDK by visiting the project's GitHub page:\n    \n    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc\n\nor running sample applications:\n\nDemo app that comes with the SDK:\n\n    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc/tree/master/Project\n\n“Wammer” application that shows how the SDK can be integrated into a messaging app:\n\n    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc-samples-wammer","license":"MIT","authors":{"Michael Berkovich":"michael@translationexchnage.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc.git","tag":"0.2.2"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/translationx","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Classes","resources":"Assets","ios":{"exclude_files":"Classes/osx"},"osx":{"exclude_files":"Classes/ios"},"public_header_files":"Classes/**/*.h","dependencies":{"MPColorTools":["~> 1.6"],"MBProgressHUD":["~> 0.9"]},"migrated":true}
