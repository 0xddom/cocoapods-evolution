It supports audio, video, presence, and instant messaging, and has extensive documentation. PJSIP is very portable. On mobile devices, it abstracts system dependent features and in many cases is able to utilize the native multimedia capabilities of the device.\n\nPJSIP has been developed by a small team working exclusively for the project since 2005, with participation of hundreds of developers from around the world, and is routinely tested at SIP Interoperability Event (SIPit ) since 2007.","license":{"type":"Dual-License","text":"PJSIP source code (\"The Software\") is licensed under both General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later and a proprietary license that can be arranged with us.

But please double check here  for OSS license compatibility with GPL.\nAlternatively, if you are unable to release your application as Open Source Software, you may arrange alternative licensing with us.
