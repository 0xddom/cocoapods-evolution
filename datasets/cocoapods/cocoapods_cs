An observer can even be cancelled from two thread simultaneously.\n* Automatic unregistering when the observed object deallocates.\n* Support for providing an observing object that is given to the block, and automatic unregistering when this observing object deallocates. This lets you call methods on `self` without retaining it or dealing with a weak reference.\n* Thread-safety for the automatic deallocation.
