Easy access to creating single constraint and features to setup own UIStackView with a little amount of constraints.\nThe idea was to create lightweight wrapper on AutoLayout without lossing access to native API. Other frameworks may have a lot of generics and operators overload that can significantly increase the time for type-checking during compilation. Some frameworks has complex API to construct layout but even do not has simple functions to take a single constraint for its managing.","homepage":"https://github.com/romdevios/LayoutChain","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Roman Filippov":"roman.filippov.dev@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"swift_versions":"5.2","source":{"git":"https://github.com/romdevios/LayoutChain.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"source_files":"Sources/**/*.swift","swift_version":"5.2","migrated":true}
