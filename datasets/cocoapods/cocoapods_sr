Support has also been added for 3 and 7 parameter datum shifts, the PJ* structure now also carries datum information and PJ* can be considered a full coordinate system (geographic coordinate systems are also now supported with the +proj=latlong pseudo-projection). The new cs2cs program performs a similar function to the proj program, but transforming from any one coordinate system to another. The new pj_transform() is used to access the extended coordinate system to coordinate system transformation with datum shifting. Work is underway to improve ThreadSafety.\n\nA mapping file (epsg) has also been introduced mapping most EPSG ( http://www.epsg.org/) coordinate systems to PROJ.4 format.\n\nAs of May 2008 PROJ.4 has become part of the  MetaCRS project, a confederation of coordinate systems related projects and it is hoped MetaCRS will enter incubation as an  OSGeo project.\n","homepage":"http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"proj/COPYING"},"authors":{"Frank Warmerdam":"warmerdam@pobox.com","Gerald Evenden":"noreply@usgs.gov"},"source":{"svn":"https://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/proj","tag":"4.8.0"},"compiler_flags":"-D_SYSTEMCONFIGURATION_H -D__MOBILECORESERVICES__ -D__CORESERVICES__","platforms":{"ios":"4.0","osx":"10.6"},"prepare_command":"    cd proj\n    ./configure\n","source_files":"proj/src/*.{c,h}","exclude_files":["**/proj.c","**/nad2bin.c","**/multistresstest.c","**/geod.c","**/cs2cs.c"],"requires_arc":false,"migrated":true}
