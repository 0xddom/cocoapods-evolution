Timeseries are compared using k-Nearest Neighbor and Dynamic Time Warping to find the nearest neighbor.","homepage":"https://github.com/trevphil/TechniqueAnalysis","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"trevphil":"trevor.j.phillips@uconn.edu"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/trevphil/TechniqueAnalysis.git","tag":"0.2.0"},"swift_version":"4.2","platforms":{"ios":"11.0"},"source_files":["Models/**/*","Utils/**/*","Views/**/*"],"frameworks":["UIKit","AVKit","CoreML","AVFoundation","Vision","CoreMedia"],"migrated":true}
