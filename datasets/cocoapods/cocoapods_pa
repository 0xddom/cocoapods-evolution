After proper configuration, this library\nallows the user to shake the phone to report bugs in the app. Very useful for clients who are not comfortable with using Github. After the phone is has been\nshaken, the library snapshots the current screen the user was on to aid in debugging. The user then is presented with a screen where he can enter the title of\nthe issue and a more detailed description. The user even has the option to add more images to upload with the issue.","homepage":"https://github.com/abellono/IssueReporter","license":"MIT","authors":{"Hakon Hanesand":"hakon@hanesand.no","Nikolai Heum":"nikolaiheum@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/abellono/IssueReporter.git","tag":"0.2.2"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.1"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Pod/Classes/**/*","resource_bundles":{"IssueReporterResources":["Pod/Assets/*.{png,strings,storyboard}"]},"public_header_files":"Pod/Classes/**/*.h","dependencies":{"AFNetworking":[]},"migrated":true}

It supports audio, video, presence, and instant messaging, and has extensive documentation. PJSIP is very portable. On mobile devices, it abstracts system dependent features and in many cases is able to utilize the native multimedia capabilities of the device.\n\nPJSIP has been developed by a small team working exclusively for the project since 2005, with participation of hundreds of developers from around the world, and is routinely tested at SIP Interoperability Event (SIPit ) since 2007.","license":{"type":"Dual-License","text":"PJSIP source code (\"The Software\") is licensed under both General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later and a proprietary license that can be arranged with us.
