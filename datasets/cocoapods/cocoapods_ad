It supports audio, video, presence, and instant messaging, and has extensive documentation. PJSIP is very portable. On mobile devices, it abstracts system dependent features and in many cases is able to utilize the native multimedia capabilities of the device.\n\nPJSIP has been developed by a small team working exclusively for the project since 2005, with participation of hundreds of developers from around the world, and is routinely tested at SIP Interoperability Event (SIPit ) since 2007.","license":{"type":"Dual-License","text":"PJSIP source code (\"The Software\") is licensed under both General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later and a proprietary license that can be arranged with us.

PTLViewDebugger helps you debug your views by adding colored borders to your view hierarchy just use `ptl_showDebugBorder` to add a randomly colored border to the view or `ptl_identifyViewLayout` to add a border to the view hierarchy you're debugging. If that's not enough, PTLViewDebugger enhances the private  [`recursiveDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2239/_index.html) API so that if you use that while debugging the resulting wall of text is styled with the border colors of each view.\n                   Additional utilities are included for visually debugging views using autolayout.

Appodeal is not an ad network; it is a new approach to monetizing for publishers.\nThe platform is a large auction house, accompanied by a mediation layer, that exposes a publisher’s inventory to all available buyers on the market via relationships with every major ad network, RTB exchange, and DSP. Appodeal showcases publisher inventory to the advertiser, and offers the highest rate in real time.\nAppodeal's goal is to cater to the needs of the publisher, not the advertiser, so you always know that you're in good hands.","homepage":"https://bidmachine.io","license":{"type":"GPL 3.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Stack":"https://explorestack.com/bidmachine/"},"platforms":{"ios":"10.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/bidmachine/BidMachine-iOS-Adaptors.git","tag":"vBDMTapjoyAdapter-1.7.4.0"},"source_files":"BDMTapjoyAdapter/*.{h,m}","swift_versions":["4.0","4.2","5.0"],"dependencies":{"BidMachine":["~> 1.7.4.0"],"TapjoySDK":["12.8.0"]},"static_framework":true,"pod_target_xcconfig":{"VALID_ARCHS":"arm64 armv7 armv7s x86_64","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphoneos*]":"arm64 armv7 armv7s","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]":"x86_64"},"user_target_xcconfig":{"CLANG_ALLOW_NON_MODULAR_INCLUDES_IN_FRAMEWORK_MODULES":"YES"},"swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}
