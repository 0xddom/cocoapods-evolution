In addition to authentication, it offers 2 ways of saving access token - user defaults or iOS keychain.\n\n\n                   ##What is It?\n\n                   MBGithubOAuthClient takes advantage of NSURLSession and a singleton pattern to setup proper authorization requests.\n\n                   ##Setup\n\n                   The easiest way to implement MBGithubOAuthClient is as a cocoa pod.  Add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n                   ```pod “MBGithubOAuthClient”```\n\n                   ##How To Use\n\n\n                   1. Register your app with GitHub to get client ID and client secret code.\n\n                   1. Get a pointer to your singleton instance.\n\n                   ```MBGithubOAuthClient *githubClient = [MBGithubOAuthClient clientWithID:kGithubClientID andSecret:kGithubClientSecret];```\n\n                   1. Setup initial parameters for GitHub access request (https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) and let MBGithubOAuthClient do the rest.\n\n                   ```[githubClient oauthRequestWithParameters:@{ @\"client_id\" : githubClient.githubClientID, @\"scope\" : @\"email,user\" }];```\n\n                   1. After successful authentication, you will be able to access your token by calling accessToken on your singleton.\n\n                   ```[[MBGithubOAuthClient sharedClient]accessToken];```\n\n                   Feel free to send pull requests for fixes or create issues to request a new feature.\n\n                   Thank you.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/michaelbabiy/MBGithubOAuthClient","screenshots":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbabiy/MBGithubOAuthClient/master/github-login-shot.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbabiy/MBGithubOAuthClient/master/github-oauth-shot.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbabiy/MBGithubOAuthClient/master/token-saved-log.jpg"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Michael Babiy":"ic.babiy@gmail.com","John Clem":"johnnyclem@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/michaelbabiy/MBGithubOAuthClient.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":["MBGithubOAuthClient","MBGithubOAuthClient/*.{h,m}"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
