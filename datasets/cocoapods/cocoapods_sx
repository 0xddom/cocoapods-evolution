Basic purpose of this component is to enable binding between models and Views without having to write a lot of unnecessary code which handels everything.\n\n\t`SKBindingManager` allows you to dynamically add or remove bindings. You can specify wheather you would like one-way or two-way binding. It has an integrated support for cycle detection in your bindings. For instance if you have object `A` with properties `a`, `b` and `c`. You will not be allowed to make bindings like this `A.a -> A.b -> A.c -> A.a` because that would cause bindings to refresh themselves indefinetly. You can also define specific transformations you want to do before for instance `A.a` refreshes object `A.b` via blocks.\n\n\t##Supported objects for binding\n\n\tBindings are supported for any kind of user defined `NSObject` subclasses and in `UIKit` for `UILabel`, `UITextField`, `UITextView`, `UISwitch` and `UISlider`. But you can add support for custom `UIView` objects.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/SlavkoKrucaj/SKBindingManager","license":{"type":"Custom","text":"Copyright (C) 2012 Slavko Krucaj.

Easy extend, easy setup, just focus on animations.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nCopy & paste `TransitionManager.swift` into your project.\n\n-  Declare a `TransitionManager` object.\n-  Init it with a [`TransitionManagerAnimation`](#Create)\n-  Assign it as your navigation controller's delegate if you use navigation controller.\n  -  Else assign it as your view controller's `transitioningDelegate`.\n\n``` swift\n\n\tvar transition: TransitionManager!\n\n\toverride func viewDidLoad() {\n\t   super.viewDidLoad()\n\n\t   transition = TransitionManager (transitionAnimation: FadeTransitionAnimation())\n\t   navigationController?.delegate = transition\n\t}\n\n```\n\n\nCreating Transition Animations <a id=\"Create\"></a>\n-----\n\n\nCreate a subclass of `TransitionManagerAnimation`\n\n``` swift\n\tclass FadeTransitionAnimation: TransitionManagerAnimation {\n\n\t}\n```\n\n`TransitionManagerAnimation` class implements `TransitionManagerDelegate` protocol.\n\n##### TransitionManagerDelegate <a id=\"Delegate\"></a>\n\n``` swift\n\n\tprotocol TransitionManagerDelegate {\n\n\t    func transition (\n\t        container: UIView,\n\t        fromViewController: UIViewController,\n\t        toViewController: UIViewController,\n\t        duration: NSTimeInterval,\n\t        completion: ()->Void)\n\n\t    var interactionTransitionController: UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition? { get set }\n\t}\n\n```\n\nFor transition animation, we should override `transition` func and write our custom animation in it.\n\n``` swift\n\nclass FadeTransitionAnimation: TransitionManagerAnimation {\n\n    override func transition (\n        container: UIView,\n        fromViewController: UIViewController,\n        toViewController: UIViewController,\n        duration: NSTimeInterval,\n        completion: ()->Void) {\n\n            let fromView = fromViewController.view\n            let toView = toViewController.view\n\n            container.addSubview(toView)\n            toView.alpha = 0\n\n            UIView.animateWithDuration(\n                duration,\n                animations: {\n                    toView.alpha = 1\n                },\n                completion: { finished in\n                    completion ()\n            })\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nOne important part is `completion()` must be called because the `TransitionManager` finishes transition after it gets called.\n\n\n### Interaction Transition\n\nCreate a `TransitionManagerAnimation` subclass and write an initilizer with `UINavigationController` parameter.\n\nAdd its `view` a pan gesture\n\n``` swift\n\tclass LeftTransitionAnimation: TransitionManagerAnimation {\n\n\t    var navigationController: UINavigationController!\n\n\t    init (navigationController: UINavigationController) {\n\t        super.init()\n\n\t        self.navigationController = navigationController\n\t        self.navigationController.view.addGestureRecognizer(UIPanGestureRecognizer (target: self, action: Selector(\"didPan:\")))\n\t    }\n\n\t}\n```\n\nWe will update `interactionTransitionController` variable in [`TransitionManagerDelegate`](#Delegate) in gesture handler.\n\n``` swift\n    func didPan (gesture: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {\n        let percent = gesture.translationInView(gesture.view!).x / gesture.view!.bounds.size.width\n\n        switch gesture.state {\n        case .Began:\n            interactionTransitionController = UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition()\n            navigationController.popViewControllerAnimated(true)\n\n        case .Changed:\n            interactionTransitionController!.updateInteractiveTransition(percent)\n\n        case .Ended:\n            if percent > 0.5 {\n                interactionTransitionController!.finishInteractiveTransition()\n            } else {\n                interactionTransitionController!.cancelInteractiveTransition()\n            }\n            interactionTransitionController = nil\n\n        default:\n            return\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nInteraction transition has 3 parts:\n* Init `interactionTransitionController` and either pop or push navigation controller when gesture (interaction) starts.\n* Calculate your `percent`s on gesture change and `updateInteractiveTransition:` with that percent\n* When gesture ended, decide if your transition complete or not and give information to your `interactionTransitionController` with `finishInteractiveTransition ()` and `cancelInteractiveTransition ()`\n\n\n### Easier `TransitionManager` setup\n\nYou can create a `TransitionManagerAnimation` container enum and give it all your animations\n\n``` swift\n\tenum TransitionManagerAnimations {\n\t    case Fade\n\t    case Left\n\t}\n```\n\nWrite a func that returns correct transition animation in enum\n\n``` swift\n\tenum TransitionManagerAnimations {\n\t    case Fade\n\t    case Left (UINavigationController)\n\n\t    func transitionAnimation () -> TransitionManagerAnimation {\n\t        switch self {\n\t        case .Fade:\n\t            return FadeTransitionAnimation()\n\n\t        case .Left (let nav):\n\t            return LeftTransitionAnimation(navigationController: nav)\n\n\t        default:\n\t            return TransitionManagerAnimation()\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t}\n```\n\nExtend `TransitionManager` and write a new init method like\n\n``` swift\n\n\textension TransitionManager {\n\n\t    convenience init (transition: TransitionManagerAnimations) {\n\t        self.init (transitionAnimation: transition.transitionAnimation())\n\t    }\n\t}\n\n```\n\nNow you can create `TransitionManager` in your view controller like\n\n``` swift\n\ttransition = TransitionManager (transition: .Left(navigationController!))\n\tnavigationController?.delegate = transition\n```","homepage":"https://github.com/cemolcay/TransitionManager","license":"MIT","authors":{"cemolcay":"ccemolcay@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cemolcay/TransitionManager.git","tag":"v0.1"},"source_files":"TransitionManager/TransitionManager/*.swift","requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
