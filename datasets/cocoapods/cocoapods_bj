Appodeal is not an ad network; it is a new approach to monetizing for publishers.\nThe platform is a large auction house, accompanied by a mediation layer, that exposes a publisher’s inventory to all available buyers on the market via relationships with every major ad network, RTB exchange, and DSP. Appodeal showcases publisher inventory to the advertiser, and offers the highest rate in real time.\nAppodeal's goal is to cater to the needs of the publisher, not the advertiser, so you always know that you're in good hands.","homepage":"https://bidmachine.io","license":{"type":"GPL 3.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Stack":"https://explorestack.com/bidmachine/"},"platforms":{"ios":"10.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/bidmachine/BidMachine-iOS-Adaptors.git","tag":"vBDMAmazonAdapter-1.7.1.0"},"source_files":"BDMAmazonAdapter/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"BidMachine":["~> 1.7.1.0"],"AmazonPublisherServicesSDK":["3.3.0"]},"static_framework":true,"pod_target_xcconfig":{"VALID_ARCHS":"arm64 armv7 armv7s x86_64","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphoneos*]":"arm64 armv7 armv7s","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]":"x86_64"},"user_target_xcconfig":{"VALID_ARCHS":"arm64 armv7 armv7s x86_64","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphoneos*]":"arm64 armv7 armv7s","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]":"x86_64"},"migrated":true}

I also found that all the libraries looked different to the facebook login method. What i have done is using the code from the facebook-ios-sdk built something that behaves the same as the facebook-ios-sdk without using OOB login for oAuth. \n\n                      The license is Apache License, Version 2.0, as i copied a lot of code from the facebook-ios-sdk. All of the copied code is in TwitterDialog.h/.m\n\n                      I also copied alot of code from https://github.com/jaanus/PlainOAuth as the basis of this project. \n\n                      The credit here should really go to Facebook and Jaanus Kase because all i have done is put their code together and made something new.\n\n                      It should be fairly self explanatory to use, but it was written quickly and might still be buggy. If you know of any bugs please tell me so i can fix them, or submit a pull request. \n","homepage":"https://github.com/doubleencore/unoffical-twitter-sdk","license":"Apache License, Version 2.0","authors":"Double Encore","source":{"git":"https://github.com/doubleencore/unoffical-twitter-sdk.git","commit":"f72311762d14d7cfabea12a7f5070238dbcc5dc9"},"platforms":{"ios":null},"source_files":["unoffical-twitter-sdk/TwitterDialog.{h,m}","unoffical-twitter-sdk/OAuth/**/*.{h,c,m}"],"public_header_files":["unoffical-twitter-sdk/TwitterDialog.h","unoffical-twitter-sdk/OAuth/OAuthConsumerCredentials.h","unoffical-twitter-sdk/OAuth/Protocols/OAuthTwitterCallbacks.h","unoffical-twitter-sdk/OAuth/Guts/OAuth.h"],"resources":"unoffical-twitter-sdk/*.png","dependencies":{"SBJson":[]},"requires_arc":false,"migrated":true}
