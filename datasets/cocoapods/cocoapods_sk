Completely thread-safe in every scenario. Simple, powerful and flexible event model allows you to bind UI updates with anything that is happening to the database and best of all, is the use of standard SQLite syntax for the query conditions. Plus far too much to fit on this page.\n\nWHY SHOULD I USE [DBAccess] ?\n\nAn ORM should not be a chore to work with, or require you to change your way of working to compensate for its shortcomings.   With [DBAccess] you simply add it to your project and start using it straight away.\n\nThe developer has full control over how the ORM operates, deciding where it puts its files, how queries are performed and on which thread.
