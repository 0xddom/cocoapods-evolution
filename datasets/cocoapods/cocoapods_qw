Currently it is a pain to build maintainable UI code in iOS. You have the choice between doing your layout in interface builder which is great for static, but not powerful enough for dynamic content, or doing all in code which is difficult to maintain.\nIn Android layouts can be defined in XML. Views automatically adjust their size while taking into account their content requirements and their parents' size restrictions.","homepage":"https://github.com/towik/UILayoutKit","license":{"type":"Apache License, Version 2.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"towik":"towik@163.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/towik/UILayoutKit.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":["UILayoutKit","UILayoutKit/**/*.{h,m}"],"frameworks":["QuartzCore","UIKit","CoreGraphics"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
