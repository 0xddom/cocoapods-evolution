It works well and everything, but being able to dive into a JSON structure, once parsed, can be quite a pain. Using a similar paradigm as what C# uses with Newtonsoft's JSON parser, this framework allows you to pass in a string as a path in a <key>.<subkey>[index] format and let the framework do the job. Now, you can even pass in a pre-parsed dictionary and have JSONParser navigate through it using the JSONPath object.","homepage":"https://github.com/sgermain06/SFJSON.git","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Simon Germain":"sgermain06@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/sgermain06/SFJSON.git","tag":"0.0.8"},"source_files":"SFJSON","exclude_files":"Classes/Exclude","pushed_with_swift_version":"3.0","migrated":true}

It works well and everything, but being able to dive into a JSON structure, once parsed, can be quite a pain. Using a similar paradigm as what C# uses with Newtonsoft's JSON parser, this framework allows you to pass in a string as a path in a <key>.<subkey>[index] format and let the framework do the job. Now, you can even pass in a pre-parsed dictionary and have JSONParser navigate through it using the JSONPath object.","homepage":"https://github.com/sgermain06/SFJSON.git","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Simon Germain":"sgermain06@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/sgermain06/SFJSON.git","tag":"0.0.6"},"source_files":"SFJSON","exclude_files":"Classes/Exclude","pushed_with_swift_version":"3.0","migrated":true}
