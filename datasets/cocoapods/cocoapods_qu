Extremely powerful, supports line, spline, area, areaspline, column, bar, pie, scatter, angular gauges, arearange, areasplinerange, columnrange, bubble, box plot, error bars, funnel, waterfall and polar chart types. 极其精美而又强大的跨平台数据可视化图表框架,支持柱状图、条形图、折线图、曲线图、折线填充图、曲线填充图、气泡图、扇形图、环形图、散点图、雷达图、混合图等各种类型的多达几十种的信息图图表,完全满足工作所需.","description":"***\n## Features\n* 🎂  **Environment friendly**. Support `iOS `、`iPadOS`  and `macOS`. Totally support `Objective-C` language, and there are more types version such as  `Swift` language version [AAInfographics](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift) 、 `Java` language version [AAChartCore](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore) 、`Kotlin` language version [AAInfographics](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore-Kotlin) . To get more details you can see the [source code links list](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit#source-code).\n\n* 🚀  **Powerful and easy to use**. It supports `column chart`, `bar chart`, `area chart`, `areaspline chart`, `line chart`, `spline chart`, `radar chart`, `polar chart`, `pie chart`, `bubble chart`, `pyramid chart`, `funnel chart`, `columnrange chart`, `arearange chart`, `mixed chart` and other graphics. Support for more chart types is planned.\n\n* 📝  **Modern Declarative Syntax**. Unlike previous imperative programming techniques, drawing any custom chart in AAChartKit, you don't need to care about the inner implementation details which is annoying && boring. *Describe what you want, you will get what you described*.\n\n* 🎮  **Interactive and animated**. The charts `animation` effect is exquisite, delicate, smooth and beautiful.\n\n* ⛓  **Chain programming**.  Supports `chain programming syntax` like *Masonry* .\n\n* 🦋  **Minimalist**. `AAChartView + AAChartModel = Chart`. The AAChartKit follows a minimalist formula: Chart view + Chart model = The chart you want, just like the powerful and beautiful charts lib [AAInfographics](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift).\n\n* 🖱 **Interaction event callback**. Support for monitoring [user click events and single finger move over events](#support-user-click-events-and-move-over-events), which can be used to achieve double charts linked-working and even multiple charts linkage, as well as other more complex custom user interaction effects.\n\n\n***","homepage":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"An An":"2236368544@qq.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit.git","tag":"5.0.4"},"social_media_url":"https://github.com/AAChartModel","source_files":"AAChartKitLib/**/*.{h,m}","resource_bundles":{"AAChartKitLib":"AAChartKitLib/AAJSFiles.bundle"},"prefix_header_contents":"#import \"AAGlobalMacro.h\"","requires_arc":true,"ios":{"frameworks":"UIKit"},"migrated":true}

Example use cases:\n\n                  * User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\n                    testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's\n                    reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n                  * Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\n                    using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\n                    problems.\n                  * Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete\n                    with a trace of how the tester reached it.\n                    \n                  Use this version of Lookback in versions of your app that you\n                  debug with or submit to testers, but not to Appstore: your app\n                  will be rejected.

Example use cases:\n\n                  * User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\n                    testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's\n                    reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n                  * Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\n                    using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\n                    problems.\n                  * Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete\n                    with a trace of how the tester reached it.\n                    \n                  Use this version of Lookback in versions of your app that you\n                  debug with or submit to testers, but not to Appstore: your app\n                  will be rejected. See the pod LookbackSafe for a version you\n                  can use in the AppStore.\n\n                  See some more examples over at http://lookback.io/examples.\n\n","homepage":"http://lookback.io/","license":{"type":"Commercial","text":"              All text and design is copyright © 2014 Lookback AB\n\n              All rights reserved.

Example use cases:\n\n* Remote research. Invite testers to test your app with just a\n  Participate link, and no additional setp.\n* User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\n  testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's\n  reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n* Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\n  using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\n  problems.\n\nHead over to [the SDK guide on our website](http://help.lookback.io/installing-the-ios-sdk/configuring-lookback/configuring-lookback-participate) to get started!\n\nNOTE: There used to be separate \"Lookback\" and \"LookbackSafe\" pods.
