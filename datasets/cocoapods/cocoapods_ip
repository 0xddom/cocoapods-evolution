Storyboard provides ways to change colour and fonts of UIComponents. Wow, thats really wonderful.\n\nBut since the font and colour of each component is hardcoded in storyboard, its really time consuming and a tedious job to change the font or colour schema through out the app.\n\nSay about 50 screens of the app were build using a font and color schema.\n\nNow the designer desides to change the font and colour schema throught out hte app.\n\nNow you have to go revisit all the 50 screens on the Storyboard and change the font and colour of each component. This sounds really a shit job to be done. And also this isn't done. What if they want to revert back at a later point (Versioning helps but you are dealing with Storyboard, so forget about it).\n\nYou could make use of UIAppearance. For example you could change the font and color of a button using UIAppearance, but this will change all the buttons unless overridden (But for overridden button this again seems like the above problem).\n\nWouldn't it be great if we could still set these properties in storyboard but changing the font or theme doesnt need to change in storyboard.

Storyboard provides ways to change colour and fonts of UIComponents. Wow, thats really wonderful.\n\nBut since the font and colour of each component is hardcoded in storyboard, its really time consuming and a tedious job to change the font or colour schema through out the app.\n\nSay about 50 screens of the app were build using a font and color schema.\n\nNow the designer desides to change the font and colour schema throught out hte app.\n\nNow you have to go revisit all the 50 screens on the Storyboard and change the font and colour of each component. This sounds really a shit job to be done. And also this isn't done. What if they want to revert back at a later point (Versioning helps but you are dealing with Storyboard, so forget about it).\n\nYou could make use of UIAppearance. For example you could change the font and color of a button using UIAppearance, but this will change all the buttons unless overridden (But for overridden button this again seems like the above problem).\n\nWouldn't it be great if we could still set these properties in storyboard but changing the font or theme doesnt need to change in storyboard.
