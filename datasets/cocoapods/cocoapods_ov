G is a dictionary, indexed by vertices. For any vertex v, G[v] is itself a dictionary, indexed by the neighbors of v. For any edge v->w, G[v][w] is the length of the edge.\n\nThis code is a port of a Python implementation of Dijkstra algorithm suggested by David Eppstein.\n\nSee http://code.activestate.com/recipes/119466-dijkstras-algorithm-for-shortest-paths/?in=user-218935\n\nIt also provides an implementation of a priority dictionary: a key value map which is also ordered by values.\n\nThe implementation relies on C++ stl. stl::map and stl::make_heap do most of heavy lifting. New feature of clang is used to keep C++ out of Objective-C headers: ivars in class extensions.\n\nThe project incliudes unit tests.","homepage":"https://github.com/SSU-CS-Department/MJDijkstra","license":{"type":"MIT","text":"        MJDijkstra\n        \n        Author: Dmitri Kozlov\n        \n        This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n        \n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
