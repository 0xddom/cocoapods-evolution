However, thanks to the new APIs brought by WKWebView, you can now have much more accurate loading progress callbacks.\n\nSee `DWUWebViewProgressDelegate` in [DWUWebView.h][h_file] for more details. It's a delegation style API and is really easy to use.\n\n\n#Known Issues\n\nDue to WKWebView's implementation details, you can find a list of unsupported APIs in [DWUWebView.h][h_file].\n\nBesides, due to an architectural change that forces WKWebView to process JavaScript injection on an asynchronous basis. The `stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:` API will always return a garbage value. So do not use its return value.\n\n\n\n[h_file]: ./DWUWebView.h\n[m_file]: ./DWUWebView.m\n[fb_blog]: https://code.facebook.com/posts/1146930688654547/reducing-fooms-in-the-facebook-ios-app/\n[performance_blog]: http://blog.initlabs.com/post/100113463211/wkwebview-vs-uiwebview","homepage":"https://github.com/diwu/DWUWebView","license":"MIT","authors":{"Di Wu":"diwup@foxmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/diwu/DWUWebView.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"*.{h,m}","frameworks":["UIKit","WebKit"],"migrated":true}

The standard is widely used internally at Microsoft for first party applications and services and supported across multiple logging libraries and platforms (Services, Clients - Native, Managed, JS, iOS, Android etc). The standard powers a variety of different data processing needs ranging from distributed tracing & debugging to system and business intelligence, in various business organizations.","homepage":"https://github.com/microsoft/CorrelationVector","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"documentation_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/CorrelationVector","authors":{"Microsoft":"askcodex@microsoft.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"swift_versions":"5.0","source":{"git":"https://github.com/microsoft/CorrelationVector-Swift.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"source_files":"Sources/CorrelationVector/*","preserve_paths":"README.md","frameworks":"Foundation","requires_arc":true,"swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}
