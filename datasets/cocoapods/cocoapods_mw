During the term of this Agreement, Developer represents, warrants and covenants to Centrixlink that: (a) it has all necessary rights, title, and interest in and to the Developer Apps to allow Centrixlink to insert Centrixlink Advertisements as contemplated herein; (b) it shall not use the Centrixlink Materials in connection with any Developer Apps, Content or technology that violate any law, rule or regulation, including without limitation applicable FTC regulations and COPPA; (c) it has any and all consents, authorizations and clearances from end users of the Developer Apps as may be required for Centrixlink to provide services hereunder; and (d) the Developer Apps do not and will not (i) infringe upon, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right or (ii) slander, defame, or libel any person.\n<\nRestrictions. Developer may not, and may not authorize or encourage any third party to: (i) generate fraudulent impressions of or fraudulent clicks on any advertisements, including through repeated manual clicks, the use of robots or other automated tools or any other method that may lead to artificially high numbers of impressions, downloads, or clicks; (ii) edit, modify, filter, or change the order of the information contained in any Centrixlink Advertisement, or remove, obscure or minimize any Centrixlink Advertisement in any way; and (iii) redirect an end user away from any web page accessed by an end user after selecting or clicking on any part of a Centrixlink Advertisement (\"Advertiser Page\"), provide a version of the Advertiser Page different from the page an end user would access by going directly to the Advertiser Page, or intersperse any content between the Centrixlink Advertisement and the Advertiser Page. Centrixlink may suspend Developer’s use of the Centrixlink Platform and/or terminate this Agreement immediately should Developer violate the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.\nContent. Developer acknowledges and agrees that it may not use the Centrixlink Platform in connection with any Developer Apps or Content containing, consisting of or promoting discrimination, illegal activities, hate speech, graphic violence, firearms, tobacco, illegal drugs, pornography, profanity, obscenity or sexually explicit material, and that it will notify Centrixlink immediately of any Developer Apps or Content relating to alcohol or gambling. Developer agrees that Centrixlink has no responsibility for any Content, and Centrixlink has no obligation or ability to monitor or edit the Developer Apps. Developer agrees to provide as much advance notice as is reasonably practicable (but in no event less than fifteen (15) days’ notice) regarding any material changes to the nature or design of any Developer App, including without limitation changes to the placement of Centrixlink Advertisement inventory, the type of Content, or the target audience.\nTracking Data. Developer acknowledges that unique identifiers and other technologies may be used in connection with the Centrixlink SDK Centrixlink Advertisements in order to collect and use data regarding advertisement performance and end user interests and to display Centrixlink Advertisements to end users, and that the collection of such data is regulated by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6506 and the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 312 (collectively, \"COPPA\"). Developer hereby grants Centrixlink a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicenseable right and license to ussde, copy, modify, distribute and otherwise exploit data collected through such cookies, beacons, and other technologies for Centrixlink’s business purposes. Without limiting any other terms of the Agreement or (including paragraphs 6 and 7) and this Exhibit A, during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain all consents, authorizations and clearances from end users of the Developer Apps required in connection with the use of such cookies, beacons, and other technologies. Developer shall provide or make available to users of each Developer App a privacy notification in a conspicuous manner (via a privacy policy or other method appropriate for the type of such Developer App)which (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (ii) to the extent applicable to the type of such Developer App, discloses to users of such Developer App that cookies, web beacons and other technologies may be used in connection with such Developer App. Developer shall comply with such other requirements that Centrixlink may issue in writing from time to time (including through the Centrixlink Platform) that relate to compliance with laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and industry standards relating to online advertising.\nPayment Amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Centrixlink shall pay to Developer amounts calculated in accordance with the applicable insertion order entered into between the parties and the definitions of CPM and Net Revenue set forth herein. Developer acknowledges that all payments hereunder shall be based on the impression counts used by the applicable Advertisers to pay Centrixlink. For the avoidance of doubt, all payments hereunder are based on advertisement requests from the Developer Apps that are actually fulfilled with a Centrixlink Advertisement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. All amounts received from activities Centrixlink deems to be fraudulent may be refunded to Advertisers in Centrixlink’s sole discretion.\nPayment Terms. Centrixlink agrees to pay all amounts due hereunder within 60 days after the last day of the month in which Centrixlink received the corresponding payment from the Advertiser, provided that no check will be issued for any amount less than $50 U.S. If there are any payment fees from the receiving bank, immediate bank or from paypal, Developer will be responsible for these fees. All unpaid earnings will rollover to the next pay period. All payments will be made in U.S. dollars ($U.S.). Centrixlink may deduct from such payments any withholding, sales, value added, and other applicable taxes (other than its net income taxes) which Centrixlink is required by law to deduct. Developer is responsible for paying any other taxes, duties, or fees for which Developer is legally responsible.\n \n"},"authors":{"Centrixlink":"devsupport@Centrixlink.com","peng.zhao":"peng.zhao@centrixlink.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source":{"git":"https://github.com/Centrixlink/Centrixlink-iOS-SDK.git","tag":"2.2.0"},"vendored_frameworks":"Centrixlink.embeddedframework/Centrixlink.framework","xcconfig":{"OTHER_LDFLAGS":"-ObjC"},"frameworks":["AdSupport","AudioToolbox","AVFoundation","CFNetwork","Foundation","MediaPlayer","StoreKit","SystemConfiguration","UIKit"],"libraries":["z","stdc++"],"migrated":true}
