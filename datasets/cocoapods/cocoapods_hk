Support `iOS `、`iPadOS` and  `macOS`. Totally support `Swift` language, and there are more types version such as  `Objective-C` language version [AAChartKit](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit) 、 `Java` language version [AAChartCore](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore) 、`Kotlin` language version [AAInfographics](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore-Kotlin) . To get more details you can see the [source code links list](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift#source-code).\n\n* 🚀  **Powerful and easy to use**. It supports `column chart`, `bar chart`, `area chart`, `areaspline chart`, `line chart`, `spline chart`, `radar chart`, `polar chart`, `pie chart`, `bubble chart`, `pyramid chart`, `funnel chart`, `columnrange chart`, `arearange chart`, `mixed chart` and other graphics. Support for more chart types is planned.\n\n* 📝  **Modern Declarative Syntax**. Unlike previous imperative programming techniques, drawing any custom chart in AAChartKit, you don't need to care about the inner implementation details which is annoying && boring. *Describe what you want, you will get what you described*.\n\n* 🎮  **Interactive and animated**. The charts `animation` effect is exquisite, delicate, smooth and beautiful.\n\n* ⛓  **Chain programming**.  Supports `chain programming syntax` like *Masonry* .\n\n* 🦋  **Minimalist**. `AAChartView + AAChartModel = Chart`. The AAChartKit follows a minimalist formula: Chart view + Chart model = The chart you want, just like the powerful and beautiful charts framework [AAChartKit](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit).\n\n* 🖱 **Interaction event callback**. Support for monitoring [user click events and single finger move over events](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift#support-user-click-events-and-move-over-events), which can be used to achieve double charts linked-working and even multiple charts linkage, as well as other more complex custom user interaction effects.","homepage":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift","license":"MIT","authors":{"An An":"2236368544@qq.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift.git","tag":"5.0.1"},"source_files":["AAInfographics","AAInfographics/**/*.{swift}"],"resources":"AAInfographics/AAJSFiles.bundle","requires_arc":true,"swift_versions":"5.0","swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}

Support for monitoring [user click events and single finger move over events](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift#support-user-click-events-and-move-over-events), which can be used to achieve double charts linked-working and even multiple charts linkage, as well as other more complex custom user interaction effects.","homepage":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift","license":"MIT","authors":{"An An":"2236368544@qq.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift.git","tag":"5.0.2"},"source_files":["AAInfographics","AAInfographics/**/*.{swift}"],"resources":"AAInfographics/AAJSFiles.bundle","requires_arc":true,"swift_versions":"5.0","swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}

Support `iOS `、`iPadOS` and  `macOS`. Totally support `Swift` language, and there are more types version such as  `Objective-C` language version [AAChartKit](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit) 、 `Java` language version [AAChartCore](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore) 、`Kotlin` language version [AAInfographics](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore-Kotlin) . To get more details you can see the [source code links list](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift#source-code).\n\n* 🚀  **Powerful and easy to use**. It supports `column chart`, `bar chart`, `area chart`, `areaspline chart`, `line chart`, `spline chart`, `radar chart`, `polar chart`, `pie chart`, `bubble chart`, `pyramid chart`, `funnel chart`, `columnrange chart`, `arearange chart`, `mixed chart` and other graphics. Support for more chart types is planned.\n\n* 📝  **Modern Declarative Syntax**. Unlike previous imperative programming techniques, drawing any custom chart in AAChartKit, you don't need to care about the inner implementation details which is annoying && boring. *Describe what you want, you will get what you described*.\n\n* 🎮  **Interactive and animated**. The charts `animation` effect is exquisite, delicate, smooth and beautiful.\n\n* ⛓  **Chain programming**.  Supports `chain programming syntax` like *Masonry* .\n\n* 🦋  **Minimalist**. `AAChartView + AAChartModel = Chart`. The AAChartKit follows a minimalist formula: Chart view + Chart model = The chart you want, just like the powerful and beautiful charts framework [AAChartKit](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit).\n\n* 🖱 **Interaction event callback**. Support for monitoring [user click events and single finger move over events](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift#support-user-click-events-and-move-over-events), which can be used to achieve double charts linked-working and even multiple charts linkage, as well as other more complex custom user interaction effects.","homepage":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift","license":"MIT","authors":{"An An":"2236368544@qq.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift.git","tag":"6.0.0"},"source_files":"AAInfographics/**/*.{swift}","exclude_files":"AAInfographics/**/PackageBundlePathLoader.swift","resources":"AAInfographics/AAJSFiles.bundle","requires_arc":true,"swift_versions":"5.0","swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}

Extremely powerful, supports line, spline, area, areaspline, column, bar, pie, scatter, angular gauges, arearange, areasplinerange, columnrange, bubble, box plot, error bars, funnel, waterfall and polar chart types. 极其精美而又强大的跨平台数据可视化图表框架,支持柱状图、条形图、折线图、曲线图、折线填充图、曲线填充图、气泡图、扇形图、环形图、散点图、雷达图、混合图等各种类型的多达几十种的信息图图表,完全满足工作所需.","description":"## Features\n\n* 🎂  **Environment friendly**. Support `iOS `、`iPadOS` and  `macOS`. Totally support `Swift` language, and there are more types version such as  `Objective-C` language version [AAChartKit](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit) 、 `Java` language version [AAChartCore](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore) 、`Kotlin` language version [AAInfographics](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartCore-Kotlin) . To get more details you can see the [source code links list](https://github.com/AAChartModel/AAChartKit-Swift#source-code).\n\n* 🚀  **Powerful and easy to use**. It supports `column chart`, `bar chart`, `area chart`, `areaspline chart`, `line chart`, `spline chart`, `radar chart`, `polar chart`, `pie chart`, `bubble chart`, `pyramid chart`, `funnel chart`, `columnrange chart`, `arearange chart`, `mixed chart` and other graphics. Support for more chart types is planned.\n\n* 📝  **Modern Declarative Syntax**. Unlike previous imperative programming techniques, drawing any custom chart in AAChartKit, you don't need to care about the inner implementation details which is annoying && boring. *Describe what you want, you will get what you described*.\n\n* 🎮  **Interactive and animated**. The charts `animation` effect is exquisite, delicate, smooth and beautiful.\n\n* ⛓  **Chain programming**.
