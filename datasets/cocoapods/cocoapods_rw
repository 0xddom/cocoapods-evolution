Well, unlike the others out there, `MMMSwitch`:\n\n* Works great in Auto Layout environments\n  * It won't get distorted when it gets resized due to changing constraints or when it gets its size animated\n* Has a *rich state callback method* \n  * It can distinguish between all user-distinguishable states, so it can tell you whether it's completely off, or if, for instance, the user's pressing it down but has yet switched its state yet. \n  * Too much info for you? No problem -- just use the callback but check `MMMSwitch`'s `isOn` parameter inside of the callback and get the basic on/off info you want.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch/","screenshots":["http://f.cl.ly/items/2x123j0K3t471g3e0I0C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.13%20PM.gif","http://cl.ly/image/042L0F381J3n/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.15%20PM.gif","http://f.cl.ly/items/2A1s0o2M193M3s310D3C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.16%20PM.gif"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":"Matthew McCroskey","social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/mmccroskey","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"source_files":["Pod","Pod/**/*.{h,m}"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}

Well, unlike the others out there, `MMMSwitch`:\n\n* Works great in Auto Layout environments\n  * It won't get distorted when it gets resized due to changing constraints or when it gets its size animated\n* Has a *rich state callback method* \n  * It can distinguish between all user-distinguishable states, so it can tell you whether it's completely off, or if, for instance, the user's pressing it down but has yet switched its state yet. \n  * Too much info for you? No problem -- just use the callback but check `MMMSwitch`'s `isOn` parameter inside of the callback and get the basic on/off info you want.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch/","screenshots":["http://f.cl.ly/items/2x123j0K3t471g3e0I0C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.13%20PM.gif","http://cl.ly/image/042L0F381J3n/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.15%20PM.gif","http://f.cl.ly/items/2A1s0o2M193M3s310D3C/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-02%20at%2005.16%20PM.gif"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":"Matthew McCroskey","social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/mmccroskey","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mmccroskey/MMMSwitch.git","tag":"0.1.1"},"source_files":["Pod","Pod/**/*.{h,m}"],"requires_arc":true,"migrated":true}
