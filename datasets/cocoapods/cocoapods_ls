To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'RestingKit'\n```\n\n## Example project\n\nAn example project is included within the repositry. To run it, first execute `pod install`, then open `RestingKit.xcworkspace`. If you want to test file uploads with the example app, go into the `image_server` directory and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:9000 -c .`, which will start a dummy server for your uploads. The uploads will be stored in the `uploads` directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic example\n\n1. Create a `RestingClient`\n\n```swift\nimport RestingKit\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\")\n```\n\n`RestingClient` is the core class within RestingKit that does the heavy lifting by executing the requests. It is configured to use a single base URL, so if you need to access multiple APIs, you'll need to create multiple clients.\n\n2. Define your models and endpoints\n\n   ```swift\n   struct PostCreateModel: Codable {\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n\n       init(userId: Int, title: String, body: String) {\n           self.userId = userId\n           self.title = title\n           self.body = body\n       }\n   }\n\n   struct PostModel: Codable {\n       let id: Int\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n   }\n\n   let createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel>(.post,\n                                                                 \"/posts\",\n                                                                 encoding: .json)\n   ```\n\n   An `Endpoint` is defined by the models of the request and response, the path (relative to the `RestingClient`'s `baseUrl`), the HTTP method to use and the encoding. If the request doesn't expect any content or doesn't return anything, you can use the special `Nothing` class. Ideally, we would use `Void`, but it is not possible to make it `Encodable` or `Decodable`.\n\n3. Create the request and make the actual call\n\n   ```swift\n   let postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                         title: \"Hello world\",\n                                         body: \"Some awesome message\")\n   let request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                                body: postCreateModel)\n   restingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n        print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n        let post = response.body\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n   }.catch { error in\n        print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n   }\n   ```\n\n   The promise will fail when the server responds with an HTTP status >299, so you don't have to handle this case.\n\n   And that's it!\n\n### Handling responses with no content\n\nIf a request might provide a response that might be empty, you can create an `Endpoint` with an optional response type. That way, if the response is empty, `nil` will be returned.\n\n```swift\nlet createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel?>(.post,\n                                                               \"/posts\",\n                                                               encoding: .json)\nlet postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                      title: \"Hello world\",\n                                      body: \"Some awesome message\")\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                             body: postCreateModel)\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n    if let post = response.body {\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Empty body\")\n    }\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** For this feature to work, the response needs to be truely empty (ie. a content-length of 0). An empty JSON object will produce a decoding error.\n\n### Path variables\n\nThe provided `RestingRequestConverter` allows templating in paths by using [Mustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift).\n\n```swift\nlet getPostEndpoint = Endpoint<Nothing, PostModel>(.get,\n                                                   \"/posts/{{post_id}}\",\n                                                   encoding: .query)\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: getPostEndpoint,\n                             body: Nothing(),\n                             pathVariables: [\"post_id\": 1])\n\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Got post: \\(response.body)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Multipart form data & file upload\n\nIt is possible to perform a multipart form data request with RestingKit. The only thing to make the request is to set the `Endpoint`'s encoding to `.multipartFormData`:\n\n```swift\nlet multipartEndpoint = Endpoint<MyModel, Nothing>(.post,\n                                                   \"/some_resource\",\n                                                   encoding: .multipartFormData)\n```\n\nNow, each request using this endpoint will be encoded as `multipart/form-data`.\nUploading files is also that easy. You can use the provided `MultipartFile` class within your models, and magically, the file will be uploaded.\n\n```swift\nclass ImageUploadModel: Encodable {\n    let file: MultipartFile\n    init(imageURL: URL) {\n        self.file = MultipartFile(url: imageURL)\n    }\n}\n\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: multipartEndpoint,\n                             body: ImageUploadModel(url: imageUrl))\nrestingClient.upload(request).promise.done { _ in\n    print(\"Success!\")\n}.catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\($0)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You should use `upload` methods on the `RestingClient` instead of `perform` when dealing with files and large amounts of data. `perform` will load the whole request body into memory,\nwhile `upload` will store it into a temporary file and stream it without loading into memory.\n\nThe encoding is handled by the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`, which provides an interface and configuration options similar to `JSONEncoder`. You can customize the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`\nused by the `RestingRequestConverter`:\n\n```swift\nlet formDataEncoder = MultipartFormDataEncoder()\nformDataEncoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\nformDataEncoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970\nformDataEncoder.dataEncodingStrategy = .raw\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(multipartFormDataEncoder: formDataEncoder)\nlet converter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\n### Progress handlers\n\n`RestingClient`'s `upload` methods returns a `ProgressablePromise`, which acts like classic promisses but also\naccept a progress handlers.\n\n```swift\nrestingClient.upload(request).progress { progress in\n    print(\"Upload \\(progress.fractionCompleted * 100)% completed\")\n}.done { response in\n    print(\"Uploaded completed with response: \\(response)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n- Retrying failed requests\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution)\n        -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n        return execution(request).get { response in\n            print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var urlRequest = request.urlRequest\n        urlRequest.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                           forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        let request = BasicHTTPRequest(urlRequest: urlRequest, fileUrl: request.fileUrl)\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`.\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request. Unless, of course, you do not want to run additional interceptors or send the request.\n\n### Using a custom HTTPClient\n\n`HTTPClient`s are the classes that performs the requests. They take an `HTTPRequest` and return a `(Progressable)Promise<HTTPDataResponse>` without doing anything. `AlamofireClient` is the provided implementation that uses Alamofire to perform the requests and the default client used by `RestingClient`. You can configure a `RestingClient` to use your own implementation:\n\n```swift\nclass MyHTTPClient: HTTPClient {\n    public func perform(urlRequest: URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle classic request\n    }\n    func upload(request: HTTPRequest) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle uplaod request, with a progress handler\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  httpClient: MyHTTPClient())\n```\n\n### Always-on headers and path variables\n\nSometimes, you need to include the same headers or path variables in all requests. RestingKit has you covered! `RestingRequestConverter` can be configured add headers and include path variables in all requests.\n\nFor example, the `DeviceIdInjector` interceptor can be re-written the following way:\n\n```swift\nlet headerProvider = RestingHeaderProvider(providers: [ \"device-id\": { UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString } ])\n\n// Or\n\nheaderProvider.addHeader(key: \"device-id\") { UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString }\n\n// Or\n\nif let deviceId = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString {\n    headerProvider.addHeader(key: \"device-id\", value: deviceId)\n}\n\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(headerProvider: headerProvider)\nlet requestConverter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\nNow, `device-id` will be present in all requests.\n\nIn the same way, you can provide path variables:\n\n```swift\nlet pathVariableProvider = RestingPathVariableProvider(providers: [ \"userId\": { AuthManager.user?.id } ])\n\n// Or\n\npathVariableProvider.addVariable(key: \"user-id\") { AuthManager.user?.id }\n\n// Or\n\nif let userId = AuthManager.user?.id {\n    pathVariableProvider.addVariable(key: \"user-id\", value: userId)\n}\n\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(pathVariableProvider: pathVariableProvider)\nlet requestConverter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\nYou will now be able to use a path like `/users/{{userId}}/info` without providing the `userId` to the `RestingRequest`.\n\nWhen using header and path variable providers, the values added to individual requests overrides the one provided by providers.\n\n## Work in progress\n\nAs RestingKit is still new and in development, there are some missing features that needs implementation:\n\n- File downloads\n- Any other feature you might request!\n\nAdditionally, there might be some api-breaking changes until the project reaches full maturity.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you need help with getting started or have a feature request, just open up an issue.

An empty JSON object will produce a decoding error.\n\n### Path variables\n\nThe provided `RestingRequestConverter` allows templating in paths by using [Mustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift).\n\n```swift\nlet getPostEndpoint = Endpoint<Nothing, PostModel>(path: \"/posts/{{post_id}}\",\n                                                   method: .get,\n                                                   encoding: .query)\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: Endpoints.Posts.get,\n                             body: Nothing(),\n                             pathVariables: [\"post_id\": 1])\n\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Got post: \\(response.body)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: URLRequest,\n                   execution: (URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse>) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse>\n    print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n    return execution.get { response in\n        print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: URLRequest,\n                   execution: (URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse>)\n        -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var request = request\n        request.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                         forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request. Unless, of course, you do not want to run additional interceptors or send the request.\n\n### Using a custom HTTPClient\n\n`HTTPClient` s are the class that performs the requests, takes a `URLRequest` and returns a `Promise<HTTPDataResponse>` without doing anything. `AlamofireClient` is the provided implementation that uses Alamofire to perform the requests and the default client used by `RestingClient`. You can configure a `RestingClient` to use your own implementation:\n\n```swift\nclass MyHTTPClient: HTTPClient {\n    public func perform(urlRequest: URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Do your stuff here\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  httpClient: MyHTTPClient(),\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter)\n```\n\n\n\n## Work in progress\n\nAs RestingKİt is still new and in development, there are some missing features that needs implementation:\n\n- File uploads and downloads\n- Multipart requests and responses\n- Progress callbacks\n- Any other feature you might request!\n\nAdditionally, there might be some api-breaking changes until the project reaches full-maturity.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you need help with getting started or have a feature request, just open up an issue.

For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate RestingKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:\n\n### Carthage\n\n[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate RestingKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:\n\n```ogdl\ngithub \"moray95/RestingKit\"\n```\n\n## Example project\n\nAn example project is included within the repositry. To run it, first execute `carthage update`, then open `RestingKit.project`. If you want to test file uploads with the example app, go into the `image_server` directory and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:9000 -c .`, which will start a dummy server for your uploads. The uploads will be stored in the `uploads` directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic example\n\n1. Create a `RestingClient`\n\n```swift\nimport RestingKit\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\")\n```\n\n`RestingClient` is the core class within RestingKit that does the heavy lifting by executing the requests. It is configured to use a single base URL, so if you need to access multiple APIs, you'll need to create multiple clients.\n\n2. Define your models and endpoints\n\n   ```swift\n   struct PostCreateModel: Codable {\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n\n       init(userId: Int, title: String, body: String) {\n           self.userId = userId\n           self.title = title\n           self.body = body\n       }\n   }\n\n   struct PostModel: Codable {\n       let id: Int\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n   }\n\n   let createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel>(.post,\n                                                                 \"/posts\",\n                                                                 encoding: .json)\n   ```\n\n   An `Endpoint` is defined by the models of the request and response, the path (relative to the `RestingClient`'s `baseUrl`), the HTTP method to use and the encoding. If the request doesn't expect any content or doesn't return anything, you can use the special `Nothing` class. Ideally, we would use `Void`, but it is not possible to make it `Encodable` or `Decodable`.\n\n3. Create the request and make the actual call\n\n   ```swift\n   let postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                         title: \"Hello world\",\n                                         body: \"Some awesome message\")\n   let request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                                body: postCreateModel)\n   restingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n        print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n        let post = response.body\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n   }.catch { error in\n        print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n   }\n   ```\n\n   The promise will fail when the server responds with an HTTP status >299, so you don't have to handle this case.\n\n   And that's it!\n\n### Handling responses with no content\n\nIf a request might provide a response that might be empty, you can create an `Endpoint` with an optional response type. That way, if the response is empty, `nil` will be returned.\n\n```swift\nlet createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel?>(.post,\n                                                               \"/posts\",\n                                                               encoding: .json)\nlet postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                      title: \"Hello world\",\n                                      body: \"Some awesome message\")\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                             body: postCreateModel)\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n    if let post = response.body {\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Empty body\")\n    }\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** For this feature to work, the response needs to be truely empty (ie. a content-length of 0). An empty JSON object will produce a decoding error.\n\n### Path variables\n\nThe provided `RestingRequestConverter` allows templating in paths by using [Mustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift).\n\n```swift\nlet getPostEndpoint = Endpoint<Nothing, PostModel>(.get,\n                                                   \"/posts/{{post_id}}\",\n                                                   encoding: .query)\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: getPostEndpoint,\n                             body: Nothing(),\n                             pathVariables: [\"post_id\": 1])\n\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Got post: \\(response.body)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Multipart form data & file upload\n\nIt is possible to perform a multipart form data request with RestingKit. The only thing to make the request is to set the `Endpoint`'s encoding to `.multipartFormData`:\n\n```swift\nlet multipartEndpoint = Endpoint<MyModel, Nothing>(.post,\n                                                   \"/some_resource\",\n                                                   encoding: .multipartFormData)\n```\n\nNow, each request using this endpoint will be encoded as `multipart/form-data`.\nUploading files is also that easy. You can use the provided `MultipartFile` class within your models, and magically, the file will be uploaded.\n\n```swift\nclass ImageUploadModel: Encodable {\n    let file: MultipartFile\n    init(imageURL: URL) {\n        self.file = MultipartFile(url: imageURL)\n    }\n}\n\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: multipartEndpoint,\n                             body: ImageUploadModel(url: imageUrl))\nrestingClient.upload(request).promise.done { _ in\n    print(\"Success!\")\n}.catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\($0)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You should use `upload` methods on the `RestingClient` instead of `perform` when dealing with files and large amounts of data. `perform` will load the whole request body into memory,\nwhile `upload` will store it into a temporary file and stream it without loading into memory.\n\nThe encoding is handled by the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`, which provides an interface and configuration options similar to `JSONEncoder`. You can customize the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`\nused by the `RestingRequestConverter`:\n\n```swift\nlet formDataEncoder = MultipartFormDataEncoder()\nformDataEncoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\nformDataEncoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970\nformDataEncoder.dataEncodingStrategy = .raw\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(multipartFormDataEncoder: formDataEncoder)\nlet converter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\n### Progress handlers\n\n`RestingClient`'s `upload` methods returns a `ProgressablePromise`, which acts like classic promisses but also\naccept a progress handlers.\n\n```swift\nrestingClient.upload(request).progress { progress in\n    print(\"Upload \\(progress.fractionCompleted * 100)% completed\")\n}.done { response in\n    print(\"Uploaded completed with response: \\(response)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n- Retrying failed requests\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution)\n        -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n        return execution(request).get { response in\n            print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var urlRequest = request.urlRequest\n        urlRequest.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                           forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        let request = BasicHTTPRequest(urlRequest: urlRequest, fileUrl: request.fileUrl)\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`.\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request. Unless, of course, you do not want to run additional interceptors or send the request.\n\n### Using a custom HTTPClient\n\n`HTTPClient`s are the classes that performs the requests. They take an `HTTPRequest` and return a `(Progressable)Promise<HTTPDataResponse>` without doing anything. `AlamofireClient` is the provided implementation that uses Alamofire to perform the requests and the default client used by `RestingClient`. You can configure a `RestingClient` to use your own implementation:\n\n```swift\nclass MyHTTPClient: HTTPClient {\n    public func perform(urlRequest: URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle classic request\n    }\n    func upload(request: HTTPRequest) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle uplaod request, with a progress handler\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  httpClient: MyHTTPClient())\n```\n\n### Always-on headers and path variables\n\nSometimes, you need to include the same headers or path variables in all requests. RestingKit has you covered! `RestingRequestConverter` can be configured add headers and include path variables in all requests.\n\nFor example, the `DeviceIdInjector` interceptor can be re-written the following way:\n\n```swift\nlet headerProvider = RestingHeaderProvider(providers: [ \"device-id\": { UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString } ])\n\n// Or\n\nheaderProvider.addHeader(key: \"device-id\") { UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString }\n\n// Or\n\nif let deviceId = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString {\n    headerProvider.addHeader(key: \"device-id\", value: deviceId)\n}\n\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(headerProvider: headerProvider)\nlet requestConverter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\nNow, `device-id` will be present in all requests.\n\nIn the same way, you can provide path variables:\n\n```swift\nlet pathVariableProvider = RestingPathVariableProvider(providers: [ \"userId\": { AuthManager.user?.id } ])\n\n// Or\n\npathVariableProvider.addVariable(key: \"user-id\") { AuthManager.user?.id }\n\n// Or\n\nif let userId = AuthManager.user?.id {\n    pathVariableProvider.addVariable(key: \"user-id\", value: userId)\n}\n\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(pathVariableProvider: pathVariableProvider)\nlet requestConverter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\nYou will now be able to use a path like `/users/{{userId}}/info` without providing the `userId` to the `RestingRequest`.\n\nWhen using header and path variable providers, the values added to individual requests overrides the one provided by providers.\n\n## Work in progress\n\nAs RestingKit is still new and in development, there are some missing features that needs implementation:\n\n- File downloads\n- Any other feature you might request!\n\nAdditionally, there might be some api-breaking changes until the project reaches full maturity.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you need help with getting started or have a feature request, just open up an issue.

If you want to test file uploads with the example app, go into the `image_server` directory and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:9000 -c .`, which will start a dummy server for your uploads. The uploads will be stored in the `uploads` directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic example\n\n1. Create a `RestingClient`\n\n```swift\nimport RestingKit\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\")\n```\n\n`RestingClient` is the core class within RestingKit that does the heavy lifting by executing the requests. It is configured to use a single base URL, so if you need to access multiple APIs, you'll need to create multiple clients.\n\n2. Define your models and endpoints\n\n   ```swift\n   struct PostCreateModel: Codable {\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n\n       init(userId: Int, title: String, body: String) {\n           self.userId = userId\n           self.title = title\n           self.body = body\n       }\n   }\n\n   struct PostModel: Codable {\n       let id: Int\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n   }\n\n   let createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel>(.post,\n                                                                 \"/posts\",\n                                                                 encoding: .json)\n   ```\n\n   An `Endpoint` is defined by the models of the request and response, the path (relative to the `RestingClient`'s `baseUrl`), the HTTP method to use and the encoding. If the request doesn't expect any content or doesn't return anything, you can use the special `Nothing` class. Ideally, we would use `Void`, but it is not possible to make it `Encodable` or `Decodable`.\n\n3. Create the request and make the actual call\n\n   ```swift\n   let postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                         title: \"Hello world\",\n                                         body: \"Some awesome message\")\n   let request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                                body: postCreateModel)\n   restingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n        print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n        let post = response.body\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n   }.catch { error in\n        print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n   }\n   ```\n\n   The promise will fail when the server responds with an HTTP status >299, so you don't have to handle this case.\n\n   And that's it!\n\n### Handling responses with no content\n\nIf a request might provide a response that might be empty, you can create an `Endpoint` with an optional response type. That way, if the response is empty, `nil` will be returned.\n\n```swift\nlet createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel?>(.post,\n                                                               \"/posts\",\n                                                               encoding: .json)\nlet postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                      title: \"Hello world\",\n                                      body: \"Some awesome message\")\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                             body: postCreateModel)\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n    if let post = response.body {\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Empty body\")\n    }\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** For this feature to work, the response needs to be truely empty (ie. a content-length of 0). An empty JSON object will produce a decoding error.\n\n### Path variables\n\nThe provided `RestingRequestConverter` allows templating in paths by using [Mustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift).\n\n```swift\nlet getPostEndpoint = Endpoint<Nothing, PostModel>(.get,\n                                                   \"/posts/{{post_id}}\",\n                                                   encoding: .query)\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: getPostEndpoint,\n                             body: Nothing(),\n                             pathVariables: [\"post_id\": 1])\n\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Got post: \\(response.body)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Multipart form data & file upload\n\nIt is possible to perform a multipart form data request with RestingKit. The only thing to make the request is to set the `Endpoint`'s encoding to `.multipartFormData`:\n\n```swift\nlet multipartEndpoint = Endpoint<MyModel, Nothing>(.post,\n                                                   \"/some_resource\",\n                                                   encoding: .multipartFormData)\n```\n\nNow, each request using this endpoint will be encoded as `multipart/form-data`.\nUploading files is also that easy. You can use the provided `MultipartFile` class within your models, and magically, the file will be uploaded.\n\n```swift\nclass ImageUploadModel: Encodable {\n    let file: MultipartFile\n    init(imageURL: URL) {\n        self.file = MultipartFile(url: imageURL)\n    }\n}\n\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: multipartEndpoint,\n                             body: ImageUploadModel(url: imageUrl))\nrestingClient.upload(request).promise.done { _ in\n    print(\"Success!\")\n}.catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\($0)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You should use `upload` methods on the `RestingClient` instead of `perform` when dealing with files and large amounts of data. `perform` will load the whole request body into memory,\nwhile `upload` will store it into a temporary file and stream it without loading into memory.\n\nThe encoding is handled by the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`, which provides an interface and configuration options similar to `JSONEncoder`. You can customize the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`\nused by the `RestingRequestConverter`:\n\n```swift\nlet formDataEncoder = MultipartFormDataEncoder()\nformDataEncoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\nformDataEncoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970\nformDataEncoder.dataEncodingStrategy = .raw\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(multipartFormDataEncoder: formDataEncoder)\nlet converter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\n### Progress handlers\n\n`RestingClient`'s `upload` methods returns a `ProgressablePromise`, which acts like classic promisses but also\naccept a progress handlers.\n\n```swift\nrestingClient.upload(request).progress { progress in\n    print(\"Upload \\(progress.fractionCompleted * 100)% completed\")\n}.done { response in\n    print(\"Uploaded completed with response: \\(response)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n- Retrying failed requests\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution)\n        -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n        return execution(request).get { response in\n            print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var urlRequest = request.urlRequest\n        urlRequest.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                           forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        let request = BasicHTTPRequest(urlRequest: urlRequest, fileUrl: request.fileUrl)\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`.\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request. Unless, of course, you do not want to run additional interceptors or send the request.\n\n### Using a custom HTTPClient\n\n`HTTPClient`s are the classes that performs the requests. They take an `HTTPRequest` and return a `(Progressable)Promise<HTTPDataResponse>` without doing anything. `AlamofireClient` is the provided implementation that uses Alamofire to perform the requests and the default client used by `RestingClient`. You can configure a `RestingClient` to use your own implementation:\n\n```swift\nclass MyHTTPClient: HTTPClient {\n    public func perform(urlRequest: URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle classic request\n    }\n    func upload(request: HTTPRequest) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle uplaod request, with a progress handler\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  httpClient: MyHTTPClient())\n```\n\n### Always-on headers and path variables\n\nSometimes, you need to include the same headers or path variables in all requests. RestingKit has you covered! `RestingRequestConverter` can be configured add headers and include path variables in all requests.\n\nFor example, the `DeviceIdInjector` interceptor can be re-written the following way:\n\n```swift\nlet headerProvider = RestingHeaderProvider(providers: [ \"device-id\": { UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString } ])\n\n// Or\n\nheaderProvider.addHeader(key: \"device-id\") { UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString }\n\n// Or\n\nif let deviceId = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString {\n    headerProvider.addHeader(key: \"device-id\", value: deviceId)\n}\n\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(headerProvider: headerProvider)\nlet requestConverter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\nNow, `device-id` will be present in all requests.\n\nIn the same way, you can provide path variables:\n\n```swift\nlet pathVariableProvider = RestingPathVariableProvider(providers: [ \"userId\": { AuthManager.user?.id } ])\n\n// Or\n\npathVariableProvider.addVariable(key: \"user-id\") { AuthManager.user?.id }\n\n// Or\n\nif let userId = AuthManager.user?.id {\n    pathVariableProvider.addVariable(key: \"user-id\", value: userId)\n}\n\nlet configuration = RestingRequestConverter.Configuration(pathVariableProvider: pathVariableProvider)\nlet requestConverter = RestingRequestConverter(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\nYou will now be able to use a path like `/users/{{userId}}/info` without providing the `userId` to the `RestingRequest`.\n\nWhen using header and path variable providers, the values added to individual requests overrides the one provided by providers.\n\n## Work in progress\n\nAs RestingKit is still new and in development, there are some missing features that needs implementation:\n\n- File downloads\n- Any other feature you might request!\n\nAdditionally, there might be some api-breaking changes until the project reaches full maturity.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you need help with getting started or have a feature request, just open up an issue.

You can customize the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`\nused by the `RestingRequestConverter`:\n\n```swift\nlet formDataEncoder = MultipartFormDataEncoder()\nformDataEncoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\nformDataEncoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970\nformDataEncoder.dataEncodingStrategy = .raw\nlet converter = RestingRequestConverter(multipartFormDataEncoder: formDataEncoder)\n```\n\n### Progress handlers\n\n`RestingClient`'s `upload` methods returns a `ProgressablePromise`, which acts like classic promisses but also\naccept progress handlers.\n\n```swift\nrestingClient.upload(request).progress { progress in\n    print(\"Upload \\(progress.fractionCompleted * 100)% completed\")\n}.done { response in\n    print(\"Uploaded completed with response: \\(response)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n- Retrying failed requests\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution)\n        -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n        return execution(request).get { response in\n            print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var urlRequest = request.urlRequest\n        urlRequest.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                           forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        let request = BasicHTTPRequest(urlRequest: urlRequest, fileUrl: request.fileUrl)\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`.\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request. Unless, of course, you do not want to run additional interceptors or send the request.\n\n### Using a custom HTTPClient\n\n`HTTPClient`s are the classes that performs the requests. They take an `HTTPRequest` and return a `(Progressable)Promise<HTTPDataResponse>` without doing anything. `AlamofireClient` is the provided implementation that uses Alamofire to perform the requests and the default client used by `RestingClient`. You can configure a `RestingClient` to use your own implementation:\n\n```swift\nclass MyHTTPClient: HTTPClient {\n    public func perform(urlRequest: URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle classic request\n    }\n    func upload(request: HTTPRequest) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle uplaod request, with a progress handler\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  httpClient: MyHTTPClient(),\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter)\n```\n\n## Work in progress\n\nAs RestingKit is still new and in development, there are some missing features that needs implementation:\n\n- File downloads\n- Any other feature you might request!\n\nAdditionally, there might be some api-breaking changes until the project reaches full maturity.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you need help with getting started or have a feature request, just open up an issue.

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'RestingKit'\n```\n\n## Example project\n\nAn example project is included within the repositry. To run it, first execute `pod install`, then open `RestingKit.xcworkspace`. If you want to test file uploads with the example app, go into the `image_server` directory and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:9000 -c .`, which will start a dummy server for your uploads. The uploads will be stored in the `uploads` directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic example\n\n1. Create a `RestingClient`\n\n```swift\nimport RestingKit\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\")\n```\n\n`RestingClient` is the core class within RestingKit that does the heavy lifting by executing the requests. It is configured to use a single base URL, so if you need to access multiple APIs, you'll need to create multiple clients.\n\n2. Define your models and endpoints\n\n   ```swift\n   struct PostCreateModel: Codable {\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n\n       init(userId: Int, title: String, body: String) {\n           self.userId = userId\n           self.title = title\n           self.body = body\n       }\n   }\n\n   struct PostModel: Codable {\n       let id: Int\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n   }\n\n   let createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel>(.post,\n                                                                 \"/posts\",\n                                                                 encoding: .json)\n   ```\n\n   An `Endpoint` is defined by the models of the request and response, the path (relative to the `RestingClient`'s `baseUrl`), the HTTP method to use and the encoding. If the request doesn't expect any content or doesn't return anything, you can use the special `Nothing` class. Ideally, we would use `Void`, but it is not possible to make it `Encodable` or `Decodable`.\n\n3. Create the request and make the actual call\n\n   ```swift\n   let postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                         title: \"Hello world\",\n                                         body: \"Some awesome message\")\n   let request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                                body: postCreateModel)\n   restingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n        print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n        let post = response.body\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n   }.catch { error in\n        print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n   }\n   ```\n\n   The promise will fail when the server responds with an HTTP status >299, so you don't have to handle this case.\n\n   And that's it!\n\n### Handling responses with no content\n\nIf a request might provide a response that might be empty, you can create an `Endpoint` with an optional response type. That way, if the response is empty, `nil` will be returned.\n\n```swift\nlet createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel?>(.post,\n                                                               \"/posts\",\n                                                               encoding: .json)\nlet postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                      title: \"Hello world\",\n                                      body: \"Some awesome message\")\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                             body: postCreateModel)\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n    if let post = response.body {\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Empty body\")\n    }\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** For this feature to work, the response needs to be truely empty (ie. a content-length of 0). An empty JSON object will produce a decoding error.\n\n### Path variables\n\nThe provided `RestingRequestConverter` allows templating in paths by using [Mustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift).\n\n```swift\nlet getPostEndpoint = Endpoint<Nothing, PostModel>(.get,\n                                                   \"/posts/{{post_id}}\",\n                                                   encoding: .query)\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: getPostEndpoint,\n                             body: Nothing(),\n                             pathVariables: [\"post_id\": 1])\n\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Got post: \\(response.body)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Multipart form data & file upload\n\nIt is possible to perform a multipart form data request with RestingKit. The only thing to make the request is to set the `Endpoint`'s encoding to `.multipartFormData`:\n\n```swift\nlet multipartEndpoint = Endpoint<MyModel, Nothing>(.post,\n                                                   \"/some_resource\",\n                                                   encoding: .multipartFormData)\n```\n\nNow, each request using this endpoint will be encoded as `multipart/form-data`.\nUploading files is also that easy. You can use the provided `MultipartFile` class within your models, and magically, the file will be uploaded.\n\n```swift\nclass ImageUploadModel: Encodable {\n    let file: MultipartFile\n    init(imageURL: URL) {\n        self.file = MultipartFile(url: imageURL)\n    }\n}\n\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: multipartEndpoint,\n                             body: ImageUploadModel(url: imageUrl))\nrestingClient.upload(request).promise.done { _ in\n    print(\"Success!\")\n}.catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\($0)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You should use `upload` methods on the `RestingClient` instead of `perform` when dealing with files and large amounts of data. `perform` will load the whole request body into memory,\nwhile `upload` will store it into a temporary file and stream it without loading into memory.\n\nThe encoding is handled by the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`, which provides an interface and configuration options similar to `JSONEncoder`. You can customize the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`\nused by the `RestingRequestConverter`:\n\n```swift\nlet formDataEncoder = MultipartFormDataEncoder()\nformDataEncoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\nformDataEncoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970\nformDataEncoder.dataEncodingStrategy = .raw\nlet converter = RestingRequestConverter(multipartFormDataEncoder: formDataEncoder)\n```\n\n### Progress handlers\n\n`RestingClient`'s `upload` methods returns a `ProgressablePromise`, which acts like classic promisses but also\naccept a progress handlers.\n\n```swift\nrestingClient.upload(request).progress { progress in\n    print(\"Upload \\(progress.fractionCompleted * 100)% completed\")\n}.done { response in\n    print(\"Uploaded completed with response: \\(response)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n- Retrying failed requests\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution)\n        -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n        return execution(request).get { response in\n            print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var urlRequest = request.urlRequest\n        urlRequest.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                           forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        let request = BasicHTTPRequest(urlRequest: urlRequest, fileUrl: request.fileUrl)\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`.\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request.

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'RestingKit'\n```\n\n## Example project\n\nAn example project is included within the repositry. To run it, first execute `pod install`, then open `RestingKit.xcworkspace`. If you want to test file uploads with the example app, go into the `image_server` directory and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:9000 -c .`, which will start a dummy server for your uploads. The uploads will be stored in the `uploads` directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic example\n\n1. Create a `RestingClient`\n\n```swift\nimport RestingKit\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\")\n```\n\n`RestingClient` is the core class within RestingKit that does the heavy lifting by executing the requests. It is configured to use a single base URL, so if you need to access multiple APIs, you'll need to create multiple clients.\n\n2. Define your models and endpoints\n\n   ```swift\n   struct PostCreateModel: Codable {\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n\n       init(userId: Int, title: String, body: String) {\n           self.userId = userId\n           self.title = title\n           self.body = body\n       }\n   }\n\n   struct PostModel: Codable {\n       let id: Int\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n   }\n\n   let createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel>(.post,\n                                                                 \"/posts\",\n                                                                 encoding: .json)\n   ```\n\n   An `Endpoint` is defined by the models of the request and response, the path (relative to the `RestingClient`'s `baseUrl`), the HTTP method to use and the encoding. If the request doesn't expect any content or doesn't return anything, you can use the special `Nothing` class. Ideally, we would use `Void`, but it is not possible to make it `Encodable` or `Decodable`.\n\n3. Create the request and make the actual call\n\n   ```swift\n   let postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                         title: \"Hello world\",\n                                         body: \"Some awesome message\")\n   let request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                                body: postCreateModel)\n   restingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n        print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n        let post = response.body\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n   }.catch { error in\n        print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n   }\n   ```\n\n   The promise will fail when the server responds with an HTTP status >299, so you don't have to handle this case.\n\n   And that's it!\n\n### Handling responses with no content\n\nIf a request might provide a response that might be empty, you can create an `Endpoint` with an optional response type. That way, if the response is empty, `nil` will be returned.\n\n```swift\nlet createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel?>(.post,\n                                                               \"/posts\",\n                                                               encoding: .json)\nlet postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                      title: \"Hello world\",\n                                      body: \"Some awesome message\")\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                             body: postCreateModel)\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n    if let post = response.body {\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Empty body\")\n    }\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** For this feature to work, the response needs to be truely empty (ie. a content-length of 0). An empty JSON object will produce a decoding error.\n\n### Path variables\n\nThe provided `RestingRequestConverter` allows templating in paths by using [Mustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift).\n\n```swift\nlet getPostEndpoint = Endpoint<Nothing, PostModel>(.get,\n                                                   \"/posts/{{post_id}}\",\n                                                   encoding: .query)\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: getPostEndpoint,\n                             body: Nothing(),\n                             pathVariables: [\"post_id\": 1])\n\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Got post: \\(response.body)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Multipart form data & file upload\n\nIt is possible to perform a multipart form data request with RestingKit. The only thing to make the request is to set the `Endpoint`'s encoding to `.multipartFormData`:\n\n```swift\nlet multipartEndpoint = Endpoint<MyModel, Nothing>(.post,\n                                                   \"/some_resource\",\n                                                   encoding: .multipartFormData)\n```\n\nNow, each request using this endpoint will be encoded as `multipart/form-data`.\nUploading files is also that easy. You can use the provided `MultipartFile` class within your models, and magically, the file will be uploaded.\n\n```swift\nclass ImageUploadModel: Encodable {\n    let file: MultipartFile\n    init(imageURL: URL) {\n        self.file = MultipartFile(url: imageURL)\n    }\n}\n\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: multipartEndpoint,\n                             body: ImageUploadModel(url: imageUrl))\nrestingClient.upload(request).promise.done { _ in\n    print(\"Success!\")\n}.catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\($0)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You should use `upload` methods on the `RestingClient` instead of `perform` when dealing with files and large amounts of data. `perform` will load the whole request body into memory,\nwhile `upload` will store it into a temporary file and stream it without loading into memory.\n\nThe encoding is handled by the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`, which provides an interface and configuration options similar to `JSONEncoder`. You can customize the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`\nused by the `RestingRequestConverter`:\n\n```swift\nlet formDataEncoder = MultipartFormDataEncoder()\nformDataEncoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\nformDataEncoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970\nformDataEncoder.dataEncodingStrategy = .raw\nlet converter = RestingRequestConverter(multipartFormDataEncoder: formDataEncoder)\n```\n\n### Progress handlers\n\n`RestingClient`'s `upload` methods returns a `ProgressablePromise`, which acts like classic promisses but also\naccept a progress handlers.\n\n```swift\nrestingClient.upload(request).progress { progress in\n    print(\"Upload \\(progress.fractionCompleted * 100)% completed\")\n}.done { response in\n    print(\"Uploaded completed with response: \\(response)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n- Retrying failed requests\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution)\n        -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n        return execution(request).get { response in\n            print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var urlRequest = request.urlRequest\n        urlRequest.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                           forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        let request = BasicHTTPRequest(urlRequest: urlRequest, fileUrl: request.fileUrl)\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`.\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request. Unless, of course, you do not want to run additional interceptors or send the request.\n\n### Using a custom HTTPClient\n\n`HTTPClient`s are the classes that performs the requests. They take an `HTTPRequest` and return a `(Progressable)Promise<HTTPDataResponse>` without doing anything. `AlamofireClient` is the provided implementation that uses Alamofire to perform the requests and the default client used by `RestingClient`. You can configure a `RestingClient` to use your own implementation:\n\n```swift\nclass MyHTTPClient: HTTPClient {\n    public func perform(urlRequest: URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle classic request\n    }\n    func upload(request: HTTPRequest) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle uplaod request, with a progress handler\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  httpClient: MyHTTPClient())\n```\n\n## Work in progress\n\nAs RestingKit is still new and in development, there are some missing features that needs implementation:\n\n- File downloads\n- Any other feature you might request!\n\nAdditionally, there might be some api-breaking changes until the project reaches full maturity.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you need help with getting started or have a feature request, just open up an issue. Pull requests are also welcome for bug fixes and new features.\n\n## Author\n\nMoray Baruh\n\n## License\n\nRestingKit is available under the MIT license.

{"_id":{"$oid":"61850cbd3884feee10f7cf5e"},"name":"RestingKit","version":"0.0.2","summary":"Networking made easy.","description":"# RestingKit\n\n[![CI Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/moray95/RestingKit.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/moray95/RestingKit)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/RestingKit.svg?style=flat)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/RestingKit)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/l/RestingKit.svg?style=flat)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/RestingKit)\n[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/RestingKit.svg?style=flat)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/RestingKit)\n\n## Introduction\n\nRestingKit is a higher-level wrapper around [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit) written in Swift that allows developers to concentrate on the important stuff instead of writing boiler-plate code for their REST API.\n\n## Features\n\n- Configurable HTTP client (Alamofire is currently the only one provided, but you can write your own!)\n- Path variable expansion powered by [GRMustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift)\n- Interception (and modification) of all requests and responses\n\n## Requirements\n\n- iOS 10.0+\n\n- Swift 4.2\n\n## Installation\n\nRestingKit is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'RestingKit'\n```\n\n## Example project\n\nAn example project is included within the repositry. To run it, first execute `pod install`, then open `RestingKit.xcworkspace`. If you want to test file uploads with the example app, go into the `image_server` directory and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:9000 -c .`, which will start a dummy server for your uploads. The uploads will be stored in the `uploads` directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic example\n\n1. Create a `RestingClient`\n\n```swift\nimport RestingKit\n\nlet requestConverter = RestingRequestConverter()\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter)\n```\n\n- `RestingClient` is the core class within RestingKit that does the heavy lifting by executing the requests. It is configured to use a single base URL, so if you need to access multiple APIs, you'll need to create multiple clients.\n- `RequestConverter` s transforms a `RestingRequest` to a `HTTPRequest`. `RestingRequestConverter` is the provided implementation that supports path templating.\n\n2. Define your models and endpoints\n\n   ```swift\n   struct PostCreateModel: Codable {\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n\n       init(userId: Int, title: String, body: String) {\n           self.userId = userId\n           self.title = title\n           self.body = body\n       }\n   }\n\n   struct PostModel: Codable {\n       let id: Int\n       let userId: Int\n       let title: String\n       let body: String\n   }\n\n   let createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel>(.post,\n                                                                 \"/posts\",\n                                                                 encoding: .json)\n   ```\n\n    An `Endpoint` is defined by the models of the request and response, the path (relative to the `RestingClient`'s `baseUrl`), the HTTP method to use and the encoding. If the request doesn't expect any content or doesn't return anything, you can use the special `Nothing` class. Ideally, we would use `Void`, but it is not possible to make it `Encodable` or `Decodable`.\n\n3. Create the request and make the actual call\n\n   ```swift\n   let postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                         title: \"Hello world\",\n                                         body: \"Some awesome message\")\n   let request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                                body: postCreateModel)\n   restingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n        print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n        let post = response.body\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n   }.catch { error in\n        print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n   }\n   ```\n\n   The promise will fail when the server responds with an HTTP status >299, so you don't have to handle this case.\n\n   And that's it!\n\n### Handling responses with no content\n\nIf a request might provide a response that might be empty, you can create an `Endpoint` with an optional response type. That way, if the response is empty, `nil` will be returned.\n\n```swift\nlet createPostEndpoint = Endpoint<PostCreateModel, PostModel?>(.post,\n                                                               \"/posts\",\n                                                               encoding: .json)\nlet postCreateModel = PostCreateModel(userId: 1,\n                                      title: \"Hello world\",\n                                      body: \"Some awesome message\")\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint createPostEndpoint,\n                             body: postCreateModel)\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Headers: \\(response.headers)\")\n    if let post = response.body {\n        print(\"Created post with id: \\(post.id)\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Empty body\")\n    }\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** For this feature to work, the response needs to be truely empty (ie. a content-length of 0). An empty JSON object will produce a decoding error.\n\n### Path variables\n\nThe provided `RestingRequestConverter` allows templating in paths by using [Mustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift).\n\n```swift\nlet getPostEndpoint = Endpoint<Nothing, PostModel>(.get,\n                                                   \"/posts/{{post_id}}\",\n                                                   encoding: .query)\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: getPostEndpoint,\n                             body: Nothing(),\n                             pathVariables: [\"post_id\": 1])\n\nrestingClient.perform(request).done { response in\n    print(\"Got post: \\(response.body)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Multipart form data & file upload\n\nIt is possible to perform a multipart form data request with RestingKit. The only thing to make the request is to set the `Endpoint`'s encoding to `.multipartFormData`:\n\n```swift\nlet multipartEndpoint = Endpoint<MyModel, Nothing>(.post,\n                                                   \"/some_resource\",\n                                                   encoding: .multipartFormData)\n```\n\nNow, each request using this endpoint will be encoded as `multipart/form-data`.\nUploading files is also that easy. You can use the provided `MultipartFile` class within your models, and magically, the file will be uploaded.\n\n```swift\nclass ImageUploadModel: Encodable {\n    let file: MultipartFile\n    init(imageURL: URL) {\n        self.file = MultipartFile(url: imageURL)\n    }\n}\n\nlet request = RestingRequest(endpoint: multipartEndpoint,\n                             body: ImageUploadModel(url: imageUrl))\nrestingClient.upload(request).promise.done { _ in\n    print(\"Success!\")\n}.catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\($0)\")\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You should use `upload` methods on the `RestingClient` instead of `perform` when dealing with files and large amounts of data. `perform` will load the whole request body into memory,\nwhile `upload` will store it into a temporary file and stream it without loading into memory.\n\nThe encoding is handled by the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`, which provides an interface and configuration options similar to `JSONEncoder`. You can customize the `MultipartFormDataEncoder`\nused by the `RestingRequestConverter`:\n\n```swift\nlet formDataEncoder = MultipartFormDataEncoder()\nformDataEncoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\nformDataEncoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970\nformDataEncoder.dataEncodingStrategy = .raw\nlet converter = RestingRequestConverter(multipartFormDataEncoder: formDataEncoder)\n```\n\n### Progress handlers\n\n`RestingClient`'s `upload` methods returns a `ProgressablePromise`, which acts like classic promisses but also\naccept progress handlers.\n\n```swift\nrestingClient.upload(request).progress { progress in\n    print(\"Upload \\(progress.fractionCompleted * 100)% completed\")\n}.done { response in\n    print(\"Uploaded completed with response: \\(response)\")\n}.catch { error in\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptors\n\nInterceptors allow to intercept any request and response, and modify it before the request is sent or the response processed. Some basic usages of interceptors include:\n\n- Logging requests and responses\n- Injecting headers\n- Retrying failed requests\n\nTo use interceptors, you will need to implement the `RestingInterceptor` protocol and provide your interceptor to your `RestingClient`.\n\n```swift\nclass LogInterceptor: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution)\n        -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        print(\"sending request \\(request)\")\n        return execution(request).get { response in\n            print(\"got response \\(response)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass DeviceIdInjector: RestingInterceptor {\n    func intercept(request: HTTPRequest, execution: Execution) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        var urlRequest = request.urlRequest\n        urlRequest.setValue(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString,\n                           forHTTPHeaderField: \"device-id\")\n        let request = BasicHTTPRequest(urlRequest: urlRequest, fileUrl: request.fileUrl)\n        return execution(request)\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter,\n                                  interceptors: [DeviceIdInjector(), LogInterceptor()])\n```\n\nThe `RestingClient` will pass the request to the interceptors in the provided order, while the response is passed in the reverse order. Therefore, it is important to place `LogInterceptor` at the end of the array (otherwise, it will not be able to log the `device-id` header added by `DeviceIdInjector`).\n\nRestingKit provides an interceptor for logging requests and responses: `RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor`.\n\n**Important**: It is required for each interceptor to call the `execution` parameter, as it is what will run the next interceptors and finally the request. Unless, of course, you do not want to run additional interceptors or send the request.\n\n### Using a custom HTTPClient\n\n`HTTPClient`s are the classes that performs the requests. They take an `HTTPRequest` and return a `(Progressable)Promise<HTTPDataResponse>` without doing anything. `AlamofireClient` is the provided implementation that uses Alamofire to perform the requests and the default client used by `RestingClient`. You can configure a `RestingClient` to use your own implementation:\n\n```swift\nclass MyHTTPClient: HTTPClient {\n    public func perform(urlRequest: URLRequest) -> Promise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle classic request\n    }\n    func upload(request: HTTPRequest) -> ProgressablePromise<HTTPDataResponse> {\n        // Handle uplaod request, with a progress handler\n    }\n}\n\nlet restingClient = RestingClient(baseUrl: \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\",\n                                  decoder: decoder,\n                                  httpClient: MyHTTPClient(),\n                                  requestConverter: requestConverter)\n```\n\n## Work in progress\n\nAs RestingKit is still new and in development, there are some missing features that needs implementation:\n\n- File downloads\n- Any other feature you might request!\n\nAdditionally, there might be some api-breaking changes until the project reaches full maturity.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you need help with getting started or have a feature request, just open up an issue. Pull requests are also welcome for bug fixes and new features.\n\n## Author\n\nMoray Baruh\n\n## License\n\nRestingKit is available under the MIT license.

Appodeal showcases publisher inventory to the advertiser, and offers the highest rate in real time.\nAppodeal's goal is to cater to the needs of the publisher, not the advertiser, so you always know that you're in good hands.","homepage":"https://bidmachine.io","license":{"type":"GPL 3.0","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Stack":"https://explorestack.com/bidmachine/"},"platforms":{"ios":"10.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/bidmachine/BidMachine-iOS-Adaptors.git","tag":"vBDMAppRollAdapter-1.7.4.0"},"source_files":"BDMAppRollAdapter/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"BidMachine":["~> 1.7.4.0"],"AppRollSDK":["3.1.2"]},"swift_versions":["4.0","4.2","5.0"],"static_framework":true,"pod_target_xcconfig":{"VALID_ARCHS":"arm64 armv7 armv7s x86_64","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphoneos*]":"arm64 armv7 armv7s","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]":"x86_64"},"user_target_xcconfig":{"VALID_ARCHS":"arm64 armv7 armv7s x86_64","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphoneos*]":"arm64 armv7 armv7s","VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]":"x86_64"},"swift_version":"5.0","migrated":true}
