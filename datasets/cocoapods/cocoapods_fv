的实现，比现有已知第三方更简单易用，注册url是在运行时自动注册\nCHBaseUtil_Safe 是数组或字典等的一些实用方法的封装，为了今后复用 \nCHBaseUtil_Util, 主要是开发中常用到的一些小工具，如自定义的UserDefault、FileManager、Digest、Observer、Regex、Singleton \nCHBaseUtil_JKDBModel_Category.为JKDBModel添加获取行数的方法\nan iOS app runtime debugger, vzinspector & flex 的整合及升级。FLEX ~> 2.4.0  & VZInspector ~> 0.1.3\n  1,修改VZInspectorOverlay.m，flex插件加入\n
