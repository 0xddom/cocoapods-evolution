In addition, if the JSON stream is from a MongoDB service, it intercepts and rewrites 'ObjectID(...)' and 'new Date(...)' fields, so the JSON can be parsed by NSJSONSerialization. The overhead cost for this rewriting is trivial, and several orders of magnitude faster than using regular expressions on the raw text to do it.
