The user can resize, scale, and move each subview. They can select one of them for focus of operations and set a background view.  The class supports a method to merge the background and subviews into an image.  Use the pinch gesture to scale a subview; two finger drag gesture to move a subview; one finger drag gesture to size each dimension independently; and the tap gesture to change or remove focus.  One application of this class would be to layer text over a photo and export the merged image to a file for submitting to your text messages or social networks.  Another application would be for an application to add decorations to an image.","homepage":"https://github.com/miller-ms/MMSLayeredView","screenshots":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mms.assets/cocoapods/mmslayeredview/screenshot.png","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"William Miller":"support@millermobilesoft.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/miller-ms/MMSLayeredView.git","tag":"1.0.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.3"},"source_files":"MMSLayeredView/Classes/**/*","frameworks":"UIKit","migrated":true}
