{"_id":{"$oid":"61850c893884feee10f5095b"},"name":"M13InfiniteTabBar","version":"2.2.2","summary":"An elegant redesign of UITabBar for iOS Applications.","description":"                   M13InfiniteTabBar is an elegant replacement for UITabBar. UITabBar becomes a problem when you have more than five view controllers that have the need to be accessed an equal amount of times. It maskes no sense to hide any of the tabs away under the \"More\" tab. Plus it takes two extra clicks to reach the view controllers behind the \"More\" button. M13InfiniteTabBar solves this problem by having all the view controllers on a single level. The \"extra\" view controllers can be reached by scrolling the tab bar left or right. The scrolling does pose a problem though, in which direction is my offscreen tab? M13InfiniteTabBar solves this by putting the tabs in an infinite scrolling loop. Any tab can be reached by scrolling in any direction.

It maskes no sense to hide any of the tabs away under the \"More\" tab. Plus it takes two extra clicks to reach the view controllers behind the \"More\" button. M13InfiniteTabBar solves this problem by having all the view controllers on a single level. The \"extra\" view controllers can be reached by scrolling the tab bar left or right. The scrolling does pose a problem though, in which direction is my offscreen tab? M13InfiniteTabBar solves this by putting the tabs in an infinite scrolling loop. Any tab can be reached by scrolling in any direction. M13InfiniteTabBar also has a few other features that UITabBar doesn't offer on top of that.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/Marxon13/M13InfiniteTabBar","license":{"type":"MIT","text":" Copyright (c) 2013 Brandon McQuilkin\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
