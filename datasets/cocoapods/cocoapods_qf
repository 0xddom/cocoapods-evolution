Developer shall provide or make available to users of each Developer App a privacy notification in a conspicuous manner (via a privacy policy or other method appropriate for the type of such Developer App)which (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (ii) to the extent applicable to the type of such Developer App, discloses to users of such Developer App that cookies, web beacons and other technologies may be used in connection with such Developer App. Developer shall comply with such other requirements that Centrixlink may issue in writing from time to time (including through the Centrixlink Platform) that relate to compliance with laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and industry standards relating to online advertising.\nPayment Amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Centrixlink shall pay to Developer amounts calculated in accordance with the applicable insertion order entered into between the parties and the definitions of CPM and Net Revenue set forth herein. Developer acknowledges that all payments hereunder shall be based on the impression counts used by the applicable Advertisers to pay Centrixlink. For the avoidance of doubt, all payments hereunder are based on advertisement requests from the Developer Apps that are actually fulfilled with a Centrixlink Advertisement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. All amounts received from activities Centrixlink deems to be fraudulent may be refunded to Advertisers in Centrixlink’s sole discretion.\nPayment Terms. Centrixlink agrees to pay all amounts due hereunder within 60 days after the last day of the month in which Centrixlink received the corresponding payment from the Advertiser, provided that no check will be issued for any amount less than $50 U.S. If there are any payment fees from the receiving bank, immediate bank or from paypal, Developer will be responsible for these fees. All unpaid earnings will rollover to the next pay period. All payments will be made in U.S. dollars ($U.S.). Centrixlink may deduct from such payments any withholding, sales, value added, and other applicable taxes (other than its net income taxes) which Centrixlink is required by law to deduct. Developer is responsible for paying any other taxes, duties, or fees for which Developer is legally responsible.\n \n"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/centrixlink/Centrixlink-Global-iOS-SDK.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"authors":{"CentrixlinkGlobal":"devsupport@Centrixlink.com","jiawei.xu":"jiawei.xu@centrixlink.com"},"resources":"CentrixlinkGlobal/Assets/CLGlobalAdBundle.bundle","vendored_frameworks":"CentrixlinkGlobal/Framework/CentrixlinkGlobal.framework","xcconfig":{"OTHER_LDFLAGS":"-ObjC"},"frameworks":["UIKit","AVFoundation","Foundation","CoreMedia","CoreLocation","CoreTelephony","SystemConfiguration","StoreKit","MediaPlayer","CFNetwork","AdSupport","ImageIO"],"libraries":["z","stdc++","sqlite3"],"migrated":true}

{"_id":{"$oid":"61850cdf3884feee10f9972b"},"name":"HeliumKit","version":"0.1.2","summary":"HeliumKit is a lightweight framework that sits between your web services and the business logic of your app.","description":"                        It provides basic mapping to automate conversion from DTO coming from your web services into object models of your business domain. We decided to streamline the process by adopting some libraries and frameworks:\n\n                        - PromiseKit to manage all the async code\n                        - FMDB to store data in SQLite\n                        - Mantle to convert models to and from JSON representation\n                        - MTLFMDBAdapter to convert models into SQL statements to feed to FMDB\n\n                        The main focus is to keep this framework as lightweight as possible and at the same time make it flexible enough for you to craft the perfect solution to your data transfer and storage layer. Many ideas come from RestKit as I've been using that framework for commercial apps before. But I've never been fond of Core Data as the storage architecture. I'm way too used to good old SQL statements and I can't live with the threading issues that you have to fight against when using Core Data. Core Data is great, but it's not for me.\n\n                        HeliumKit can simply keep your data in in-memory models or it can write them to SQLite as needed. That's completely configurable. I tried to keep in mind the convention over configuration paradigm as I hate boilerplate code.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/tanis2000/HeliumKit","license":"MIT","authors":{"Valerio Santinelli":"santinelli@altralogica.it"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tanis2000/HeliumKit.git","tag":"0.1.2"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/santinellival","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Pod/Classes/**/*.{h,m}","frameworks":"UIKit","dependencies":{"AFNetworking":["~> 2.3"],"Mantle":["~> 1.5"],"FMDB":["~> 2.3"],"MTLFMDBAdapter":["~> 0.1"],"PromiseKit/Promise":["~> 0.9"],"PromiseKit/When":["~> 0.9"],"PromiseKit/Until":["~> 0.9"],"PromiseKit/Pause":["~> 0.9"]},"migrated":true}
