{"_id":{"$oid":"61850c8f3884feee10f564ce"},"name":"ZZScale","version":"0.1.0","summary":"ZZScale is a handy tool for those who need really simple multi-screen adapt solutions","description":"Have you face the problem that you only got 1 set of design from your designer, but you have to adapt multiple screens?\n\nYes, you can do everything by auto-layout or manually code layout, but you have to define a lot of strategies for all places that need to be care when adapt for differnt screen size.\n\nIs there a much simpler way to do that? Yes, I provide a solution: ZZScale.\n\nThis is how it works:\n\n1. Scale your container view by ratio, either by width or height, when `viewDidLoad`\n2. You treat the layout just like in your designed screen size, if the runtime screen size is the same ratio as your designed screen size.\n3. When runtime screen size is not the same ratio as your designed screen size, it scales by the priority side (width or height), and leave the other side for further layout method.\n4. And yes, it works with auto-layout!\n\nHere is an example:\n\nYou have a scrollable screen that you want all users to see it in just same horizontal layout of iPhone6 in every devices, you can just insert the code `self.view.zz_scaleInFactorRelativeByWidth(375)` in `viewDidLoad` of your `UIViewController`.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nYou have a non-scrollable screen that you want all users to see it in just same vertical layout of iPhone6 in every devices, you can just insert the code ` self.view.zz_scaleInFactorRelativeByHeight(667)` in `viewDidLoad` of your `UIViewController`.","homepage":"https://github.com/zzdjk6/ZZScale","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Chen Shenghan":"zzdjk6@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/zzdjk6/ZZScale.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"ZZScale/Classes/**/*","migrated":true}

If yes, then this is a solution. Sometimes, designers draw UITabBar without really understanding that it needs tab architecture in the app. I created this control in a such situation. It is a UIView based Toolbar for iOS that looks like UITabBar but doesn't need UITabBarController to be used. Works both on iPhone and iPad in both vertical and horizontal orientations. It stretches automatically to the width of it's parent UIView. Also it has some features that are not present in a classic UITabBar like the possibility to disable some items and to dynamically change number of buttons.
