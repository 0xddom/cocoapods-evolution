{"_id":{"$oid":"61850ce73884feee10fa04bf"},"name":"MaterialTB","version":"0.9.0","summary":"Material Design TabBar made in Swift with beautiful animations.","requires_arc":true,"description":"# MaterialTB\nA library that makes TabBars beautifly Material and animated.\n\n## Description\niOS 11 has introduced TabBars into many of their apps, this style of navigation is becomming more and more popular nowadays. Still, iOS native TabBar can be a little dull if compared to Material Design. This Pod is meant to make your Tabbars look really cool and support Material Design's focus animations.\n\n### Installation\n\n`pod 'MaterialTB'`\n\n### Usage\n\nAfter installing the pod the steps are really simple:\n\n#### 1. In your storyboard add an empty ViewController\n\n![alt text](https://preview.ibb.co/gQ69Jk/Screen_Shot_2017_09_26_at_10_17_34_PM.png \"Storyboard\")\n\nMake sure that this View Controller's custom class is `MaterialTB` same as its module.\n\n#### 2. Add your ViewContollers how ever you like, with one condition: Your controller must extend from MaterialViewController\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport MaterialTB\n\nclass ViewController: MaterialViewController {\n\n...\n\n// This method is called whenever an opened Tab is \"reopende\" i.e: You are on\n// 'sales' tab and you tap on 'sales' tab again. By default it triggers an animation\n// but leaves the view controller as-is. You can override it to reload your VC from\n// Storyboard or do any actions you desire.\noverride func refreshViewController() -> MaterialViewController {\n// Reload from storyboard\n}\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Configure Segues in Storyboard\n\nThis is where the magic happens, when you have both your MaterialTB VC and your custom view controller that extends from MaterialViewController, you can ctrl+drag from MaterialTB to your View Controller to create a segue. In the popover you choose 'material view'\n\n![alt text](https://image.ibb.co/b7m9Jk/Screen_Shot_2017_09_26_at_10_36_20_PM.png \"Segue selection\")\n\nThen in the atributes insepctor of the segue, set the 'Identifier' to be the number of this view in your TabBar i.e: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n\n#### 4. Configure View Controller info\n\nYou can configure the information that will display in the TabBar for each View Controller in the Atributes Inspector of the View Controller\n\n![alt text](https://preview.ibb.co/j0var5/Screen_Shot_2017_09_26_at_10_34_10_PM.png \"Controller setup\")\n\n`Selected Image`: The image that will display on the TabItem when this view controller is selected. To achieve a better look-and-feel we recomend you to use a slightly biggrer image here than in the Idle Image.\n\n`Idle Image`: The image that will display on the TabItem when this view controller is not selected.\n\n`Tab Title`: The title for this view controller on the TabBar. You can leave it blank to have no text on the Tab.\n\n#### 5. You're all setup! At this point your TabBar should work. Take into account that a TabBar-like navigation is recomended for 3-5 view controllers. MaterialTB supports 1 to 5 view controllers.\n\n### Demo\n\n<a href=\"https://imgflip.com/gif/1wllsm\"><img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/1wllsm.gif\" title=\"made at imgflip.com\"/></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://imgflip.com/gif/1wlkxn\"><img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/1wlkxn.gif\" title=\"made at imgflip.com\"/></a>\n\n### Customization\n\nYou can customize the look and feel of the TabBar in the atributes inspector of the MaterialTB\n\n![alt text](https://preview.ibb.co/iLRejQ/Screen_Shot_2017_09_26_at_10_45_03_PM.png \"Controller setup\")\n\n`Initial View Controller`: This tells MaterialTB which Tab is the first loaded Tab when app launches. It's an Integer from 1 to 5.\n\n`Tab Bar Heigth`: This allows you tu customize the TabBar heigth that suits your needs. Default is 65px\n\n`Selected Tint`: This is the color of the text on the TabBar label when it is selected. It should match your 'Selected Image' main color.\n\n`Idle Tint`: This is the color of the text on the TabBar label when it is not selected. It should match your 'Idle Image' main color.\n\n`Tab Bar Background Color`: This is the color of the TabBar's background.\n\n`Font Size`: You can specify the size of the TabItem label's font. We recomend you to use anything from 9 to 15. Default is 12.\n\n`Font Family`: You can specify the Family Font for your TabBar. Default is System's. Font will fallback to default if Family specified is not found.\n\n### Support\n\nThis library is completely free of charge, if you want to support us, share this with your friends, or give us some feedback! Support is to grow.","homepage":"https://github.com/d-soto11/MaterialTB","screenshots":["https://i.imgflip.com/1wllsm.gif","https://i.imgflip.com/1wlkxn.gif"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Daniel Soto":"soto@tresastronautas.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"9.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/d-soto11/MaterialTB.git","tag":"0.9.0"},"source_files":["MaterialTapBar","MaterialTapBar/**/*.{swift}"],"pushed_with_swift_version":"4.0","migrated":true}

Payment may be made either immediately by credit card, or invoiced as provided herein. If payment is made by invoice, Ruxit will invoice the full invoice and Client shall remit payment within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Overdue invoices shall bear interest at 1.5% per month or such lower rate as shall be the then highest rate permitted by law. Client shall pay all applicable taxes due under this Agreement, except taxes based on Ruxit's net income unless Client provides Ruxit with a properly completed exemption certificate.
