JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: jsonData, options: [.allowFragments])\n\nguard\n    let jsonDictionary = jsonObject as? [String: Any],\n    let dataDictionary = jsonDictionary[\"data\"] as? [String: Any],\n    let memesArray = dataDictionary[\"memes\"] as? [[String: Any]],\n    let firstMeme = memesArray.first,\n    let memeName = firstMeme[\"name\"] as? String else {\n\n        fatalError()\n}\n\nprint(memeName)\n```\n\nWith JSONNode this becomes the following:\n\n```Swift\nvar jsonNode = try! JSONNode(data: jsonData)\nguard let name = jsonNode[\"data\"][\"memes\"][0][\"name\"].string else { fatalError() }\n\nprint(name)\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nTypically when JSON is deserialised, it is turned into nested arrays and dictionary, and since these collections need a type and the JSON could contain any of multiple types, the non-specific `Any` protocol is used.\n\nThis is not a true representation of the situation though. There can't be \"anything\" in the collection. Each node in the JSON structure can only be one of the following:\n- String\n- Boolean\n- Integer\n- Floating point number\n- Array containing something in this list\n- Dictionary with a string key and value as something in this list\n\nWith this finite list of possible values for a JSON node, a enum is the best way to represent that. Inspiration was taken from the way that Swift Playgrounds passes information been the playground page and the live view.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Swift 3\n- Xcode 8\n\n## Integration\n\n#### CocoaPods\n\nYou can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `JSONNode`by adding it to your `Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '8.0'\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'JSONNode'\nend\n```\n\nNote that this requires CocoaPods version 36, and your iOS deployment target to be at least 8.0:\n\n\n#### Manually (iOS 8+, OS X 10.9+)\n\nTo use this library in your project manually you may:\n\n1. for Projects, just drag JSONNode.swift to the project tree\n2. for Workspaces, include the whole JSONNode.xcodeproj","homepage":"http://github.com/keefmoon/JSONNode","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Keith Moon":"keef@keefmoon.com"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/keefmoon","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/keefmoon/JSONNode.git","tag":"1.2.0"},"source_files":["JSONNode","JSONNode/JSONNode/*.{swift}"],"pod_target_xcconfig":{"SWIFT_VERSION":"3.0"},"requires_arc":true,"pushed_with_swift_version":"3.0","migrated":true}

It saves you the hassle of writing boilerplate code, and encourages good practices by reducing the incentive to cut corners in your model implementation.\n\n                      The BaseModel object uses Plists and the NSCoding protocol for serialisation. It is not designed for use with Core Data, although in principle the class could be extended to work with Core Data if needed by changing the BaseModel superclass to an NSManagedObject.\n\n                      BaseModel is really designed as an alternative to Core Data for developers who prefer to have a little more control over the implementation of their data stack. BaseModel gives you precise control over the location and serialisation of your data files, whilst still proving enough automatic behaviour to save you from writing the same code over and over again.\n\n                      BaseModel is designed to work with the AutoCoding and HRCoder libraries.\n","homepage":"http://charcoaldesign.co.uk/source/cocoa#basemodel","license":"zlib","authors":{"Nick Lockwood":"email@address.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/nicklockwood/BaseModel.git","tag":"2.3.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"4.0","osx":"10.6"},"source_files":"BaseModel","preserve_paths":"RELEASE NOTES.md","requires_arc":false,"migrated":true}
