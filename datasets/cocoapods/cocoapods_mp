Design wise, FCAlertView is similar looking to the default AlertView, however, as you start customizing it for your specific need, you realize it can do a lot more and look very flat and nice. FCAlertView lets you do things such as specify the number of buttons, the color scheme of the view, adding a small image to it, hide the view after a certain time, and more.
