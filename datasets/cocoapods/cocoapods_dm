Integration is easy, takes just 10 minutes and requires only a few lines of code. A quick integration allows you to track all standard metrics such as platform, device type, sessions and unique users. Event and screen tracking are used to analyze conversion funnels, screen flows, feature usage, content access, advertising performance, etc. Full support for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and HTML5 apps.\n\n  Localytics is designed to measure apps, providing the greatest accuracy and lightest footprint. Apps are different than websites, offering richer experiences and a deeper integration with the device. Apps function offline, survive intermittent network connectivity, support multitasking and access location services, storage, accelerometers, network details and more. Localytics collects and combines rich data to help you build more successful applications.\n","homepage":"http://www.localytics.com/docs/","license":{"type":"Copyright","text":"      Copyright (c) 2013, Char Software, Inc. d/b/a Localytics\n      All rights reserved.\n\n      Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n      modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n          * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n            notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n          * Neither the name of Char Software, Inc., Localytics nor the names of its \n            contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\n            software without specific prior written permission.\n\n      THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY CHAR SOFTWARE, INC.

Integration is easy, takes just 10 minutes and requires only a few lines of code. A quick integration allows you to track all standard metrics such as platform, device type, sessions and unique users. Event and screen tracking are used to analyze conversion funnels, screen flows, feature usage, content access, advertising performance, etc. Full support for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and HTML5 apps.\n\n  Localytics is designed to measure apps, providing the greatest accuracy and lightest footprint. Apps are different than websites, offering richer experiences and a deeper integration with the device. Apps function offline, survive intermittent network connectivity, support multitasking and access location services, storage, accelerometers, network details and more. Localytics collects and combines rich data to help you build more successful applications.\n","homepage":"http://www.localytics.com/docs/","license":{"type":"Copyright","text":"      Copyright (c) 2013, Char Software, Inc. d/b/a Localytics\n      All rights reserved.\n\n      Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n      modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n          * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n            notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n          * Neither the name of Char Software, Inc., Localytics nor the names of its \n            contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\n            software without specific prior written permission.\n\n      THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY CHAR SOFTWARE, INC.
