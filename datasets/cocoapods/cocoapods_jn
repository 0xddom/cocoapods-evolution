If your app e.g. uses a 3rd party tool for analytics, it is the sole responsibility of you as the app developer, not of the 3rd party tool provider, that the analytics tool does not start registering events in the app without user explicit consent.\n\nAlthough implementing some dialog to obtain user consents and store them for further reference seems pretty straightforward, digging into it reveals (as usual with “simple tasks”) many programming and design details that must be implemented, which are not the core functionality of your app.","homepage":"https://github.com/smartlook/ios-consent-sdk/","screenshots":["https://sdk.smartlook.com/assets/SmartlookConsentSDKDemo2.gif","https://github.com/smartlook/ios-consent-sdk/raw/master/readme-media/ConsentSDK-Settings.png"],"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Pavel Kroh":"pavelkroh@smartlook.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/smartlook/ios-consent-sdk.git","tag":"1.3.0"},"documentation_url":"https://github.com/smartlook/ios-consent-sdk/","platforms":{"ios":"10.0"},"swift_versions":"4.2","source_files":"SmartlookConsentSDK/SmartlookConsentSDK/*.{h,m,c,swift}","resource_bundles":{"SmartlookConsentSDK":["SmartlookConsentSDK/SmartlookConsentSDK/**/*.{storyboard,xib}"]},"swift_version":"4.2","migrated":true}
