You can add domains (strings) to describe your code modules, classes, procedures, etc.  You then call log statements setting the domain of the message, the level (Error, Debug, or Information) and the message you want displayed.  Finally, before running your app, if you want to log a function, you add domains to the logger.  As the program runs, it will print out messages associated with the domains you have chosen.  For instance, as you are writing a web client, you would add a domain for \"web\" to be used for all classes associated with web communications, and add domains for each class, and for each function in each class.  If you want to debug the entire web communications portion, you add the domain \"web\" and run your program.  If you want to debug only a specific function, you add a domain like \"web.<class>.<function>\".","homepage":"https://github.com/n8glenn/LogJam","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"n8glenn":"n8glenn@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/n8glenn/LogJam.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"swift_version":"4.2","platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source_files":"LogJam/Classes/**/*.swift","migrated":true}

It simply compute the UIView.frame property, one view at a time.\n  * Since it is stateless, it can be used with any other layout framework without conflicts. \nEach view can use the layout system that better suit it  (PinLayout, constraint, flexbox, grids, …)\nA view can be layouted using PinLayout and later with another method.\n  * REWORK THAT!!! Stateless also means that if a view reference other views, the view should be re-layouted in layoutSubViews()  layouted with PinLayout use other views as referenced view change (size/position) \n\n* No constraints\n  * Constraints are very verbose and hard for a human brains to understand. Too much information.\n  * PinLayout positions views as a designer would explain it (eg: “The TextField is below the Label, aligned left, and is its width match the other view’s width“). \n  * No priorities, simply layout views in the order that make sense. No priority required.\n\n* Before applying the new sets of attributes, PinLayout always start with the view’s current frame. So it’s possible to set the view’s size during the initialization (ex: view.pin.width(100).height(200)), and later only position the view (ex: view.pin.top(10).left(20))\n\n* Minimize as much as possible calculations and constants when layouting views.\n\n* Methods matches as much as possible other layouting system, including CSS, flexbox, reactive Flexbox, …\n  * margin, marginHorizontal, marginVertical, marginTop, marginLeft, marginBottom, marginRight\n  * top, left, bottom, right, width, height  \n  * As in CSS and flexbox, right and bottom coordinates are offset from container’s view right and bottom edges.\n\n* Shorter possible commands to layout views, but keeping english phrasing almost valid.","homepage":"https://mirego.github.io/PinLayout/","license":"BSD 3-clause","authors":{"Luc Dion":"ldion@mirego.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"8.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout.git","tag":"1.0.5"},"source_files":"PinLayout/**/*.swift","pushed_with_swift_version":"3.0","migrated":true}
